			<h1 class="entry-title" id="title">Why Twitter?</h1>
						<div class="entry-content">
			    <p>Several of you expressed skepticism about using Twitter, and a few of you even posted that you&#8217;re not sure what the hype is all about. Its a fair question, and one that we&#8217;ll talk about tonight, in addition to talking about the readings on Web 2.0 in general and its impact on academia.</p>
<p>In addition to discussing what you learned about Twitter, I&#8217;m also curious to know what you learned <em>from people </em>on Twitter<em> </em>this past week. If you can&#8217;t tell already, I&#8217;m a pretty big proponent of using Twitter to connect to various groups or individuals doing similar work, learn more about them, and engage in conversations that may require you to find a method more conducive to your conversation than 140 characters. There are lots of things you can learn from just following a Twitter stream, even for a week. Just as a quick example, here&#8217;s what I learned from following the <a href="http://twitter.com/clioweb/au-digital-history">au-digital-history group</a> this past week.</p>
<ul>
<li>Students talk to their mother&#8217;s about Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/alexandraclane/statuses/7755447392">link</a>)</li>
<li>Some of you are concerned about lack of tech knowledge (<a href="http://twitter.com/Sh8990a/statuses/7788546158">link</a>). Interesting because there are similar concerns about barriers to entry in digital history, which culminated in an interesting discussion on Twitter yesterday involving <a href="http://twitter.com/cliotropic">@cliotropic</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/janaremy">@janaremy</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/benwbrum">@benwbrum</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/footnotesrising">@footnotesrising</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/candace_nast">@candace_nast</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/sterflu">@sterflu</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/melissaterras">@melissaterras</a>, among other. Someone even started a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/digital-humanities-barriers-to-participation">Google Group</a> to take the conversation somewhere more conducive than Twitter.</li>
<li>The Smithsonian and Library of Congress twitter accounts come across as narcissistic (<a href="http://twitter.com/RangerMoo/statuses/7794226808">link</a>). Interesting given our reading of Bauerlein and <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Teen-Narcissism/6535/">Teen Narcissism</a>&#8230;narcissism may be a trait of more people/institutions than teens? Also interesting in light of Clay Shirky&#8217;s recent <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2010/01/a-rant-about-women/">&#8220;Rant About Women,&#8221;</a> post advising women to be &#8220;arrogant self-aggrandizing jerks&#8221; if they want promotion or recognition.</li>
<li>Former student researching captivity and &#8220;white Indians&#8221; (<a href="http://twitter.com/tami24/statuses/7798200566">link</a>)</li>
<li>Some possibilities of finding connections between this class and classes you&#8217;re currently taking, or have previously taken (<a href="http://twitter.com/Rebs416/statuses/7801716761">link</a>). I always love this possibility, and welcome talking about it anytime.</li>
<li>Interesting design problem for digital history: Can (or should) physical browsing be simulated in the digital? (<a href="http://twitter.com/ALFeras/statuses/7803057295">link</a>). Similar to other questions centered around how some experiences historical content that&#8217;s been digitized. What is gained? What is lost? What are the ramifications, and are they positive enough to embark on a specific digital history project, or doing digital history in general?</li>
<li>Even history folks can understand/appreciate programmer geek humor (<a href="http://twitter.com/tlbvienna/statuses/7834703254">link</a>)</li>
<li>Where do I experience history? (<a href="http://twitter.com/Roary511/statuses/7874061555">link</a>) Certainly a pertinent question for a course about history in the digital age. I hope we could talk about how the Web, and digital history, changes the way history is experienced, and what that means for our work.</li>
<li>What are the some concerns and possibilities about using social media for therapy and counseling? (<a href="http://twitter.com/BCtoDCEagle/statuses/7963511987">link</a>)</li>
<li>Some of you are doing dissertation research, and are wondering how in the world you&#8217;ll be able to wade through archives. (<a href="http://twitter.com/Rebs416/statuses/7962932947">link</a>) Will certainly inform our discussion about digital scholarship, research, Zotero, and using search tools in general.</li>
<li>NPS is considering allowing Twitter to employees, but the NPS email seems less reliable/accessible. (<a href="http://twitter.com/RangerMoo/statuses/7888034279">link</a>) Leads to lots of interesting questions about the technical capabilities of cultural heritage institutions, their resources and staff.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a list of things I learned from you all, a group of 25 people, who have just started using Twitter. I learned a lot about you, about your concerns, your likes and dislikes, and these things contributed something back to my work, and will certainly inform how I conduct the class the rest of the semester. There&#8217;s a lot of stuff here, a lot of good stuff that will pop up in class as the semester unwinds.</p>

			<div class="entry">
				<p><strong>	The Jacksonian era was a time of major upheaval, from the lives of ordinary citizens to the government and its policies, so a utopian society would have to account for these changes</strong>.  Politically, the Nullification Crisis caused quite a ripple as the power of States to disagree with the Federal Government came into question.  Socially, temperance and suffrage were in vogue.  In terms of religion, the Jacksonian era came on the heels of the Second Great Awakening.  Economically, the North and South were split into Industrial and Agricultural production respectively; also Jackson&#8217;s move to take power away from the Federal Bank resulted in some inflation and distrust of citizens in paper money.  Culturally, The role of the individual was stressed and given agency, as opposed to the days where only those of wealth and property would have a voice.  The utopian community I put forth takes the above into account. A few key assumptions/purposeful decisions about the community are: that the community is intended to exist in South Carolina and be representative of their views.</p>
<p>The community is governed by a council elected by the people (giving the common man more power), and a chairman to preside is elected by the council from their number.  Their responsibilities pick up where Federal, State and local governing bodies left off. First, they oversee the economic wellbeing of the community.  The council takes on leadership more in a business sense than a political one.  The council is also responsible for proposing laws, though the decision to enact them would be by vote of the community.  The laws&#8217; general purpose in the community is as counterparts to the religious aspect, to prevent radicalism or abuse of the community and its ideals.  The inhabitants&#8217; vote in State or Federal elections is a matter of acting in the interest of the community, so a liaison from the council would be responsible for representing them to the State legislature (and thus betting against the Federal government in a power struggle).</p>
<p>Looking to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64813312@N00/407226455/">map of the community</a> reveals the redress of many of the problems and issues of the Jacksonian era.  The center of the community is the church (citing the recent revival), which serves as a social hub to cement the relationships of those in the community.  The same building would also host the governing body.  Presumably, at least some of the land used for the construction of the utopia would be in use as farmland.  This would remain, and be run as a business by the community council.  A few factories would be constructed as a “hedge bet” against an uncertain financial future (citing the recent tariff fiasco).  The government would run both institutions: hiring employees, building more factories if that proves to be the more profitable route and keeping with the times progressively.  As paper money was trusted less (citing the fallout of Jackson&#8217;s attack on the Bank), employees would be offered a part of their salary in goods at a government owned store where the markup would be a certain percentage set by law to create one source of revenue for the government. The businesses would be jointly owned by all the citizens.  There is no place within the community where one might purchase drink (citing the temperance movement).  The factories and farms are placed in proximity to prevent a rift from forming between the employees of each, and they are placed so that there is room for growth.  As much as possible, the utopia would be self-sufficient.</p>

			<p>Your post was very descriptive and reasonably structured.  I like how you went into detail about the authority of your community and the process of their election.  You did a great job mentioning the Jacksonian era and relating it to your community.  You clearly informed to me why you made certain decisions by referring back to certain movements in the past.  For example, &#8220;A few factories would be constructed as a “hedge bet” against an uncertain financial future (citing the recent tariff fiasco)&#8221;. Wonderful job on tying in the historical facts!</p>
<p>I had a hard time coming up with what I disliked about your post.  Everything you stated was very clear and left me with no questions.  However, I did see a few grammar errors in your post.  Your post was both enjoyable and informative!  Your introductory paragraph definitely got my attention.</p>

			<p>Your post was very clear and easy to understand. Your language was not overly complicated which also made it easy to follow. I like how you related your community to the Jacksonian era, and I found your discussion about the two very interesting. The tying in of the historical facts was a good addition instead of just discussing you own simutopica.</p>

			<p>Quite a utopia you have in mind.  Your post was very detailed and you listed everything that you wanted to have.  The introduction worked out great by you explaining the problems that there was in the Jacksonian era.  I liked how you explained what the problems were and what your solution would be to them.  Your utopia on Flickr, Johnstown, looked well thought out.</p>
<p>I think that it will be interesting to see how exactly the council deciding what laws to propose and community voting on them would work.  I do not think that you should prohibit, or not have, a place where one can purchase or consume alcohol.  This did not work during the Prohibition Era, creating more illegal action and violence, and would probably cause a great disturbance in your utopian society.</p>

			<p>I have to agree with everyone else, it was very descriptive and easy to read. We also had a few things in common with our utopias: we both left room to expand; banned alcohol; we also had a council with a main guy in charge, although it sounds like the main guy was just looking over the council, where as the council in mine was the help out the guy in charge. Banning alcohol probably isn&#8217;t such a good idea, as I know realize after getting countless comments saying so. It also sounds as though the government is trying to control every aspect of the citizens&#8217; lives, as though it&#8217;s some kind of experimental society. That might also be reason for some people to revolt, but maybe that&#8217;s just me.</p>

			<p>Your post was very clear and detailed. I loved how you explained where the buildings were, what they were used for, and why they were put there and used for the distinctive purpose.<br />
I agree with you that a council elected specifically by the people of that town would be best. That way you definately have the people in office that the citizens want! There is no debate or regret afterwards. Also, I firmly agree that the council creates the laws BUT the citizens have to vote if they want them or not. However there is a downfall to that. Of course people do not want to be regulated on certain things and would vote against something that would be for the betterment of the community. For example, a drinking age. I know you mentioned no drinking but it worked as a good example. I just think it would be hard to get the people to vote for the betterment of the community when it meant making their lives harder or inconvenient. It would work out perfectly if people voted correctly.<br />
I am not sure how I feel about the church being the center of the community. Just because someone lives in the community does not mean they HAVE to be religious does it? Church and government should be seperate. Also it seems like the government has a lot to do. Make laws, run factories etc&#8230;The people should be entrusted with running the factories.</p>

			<p>Your post had good structure and was well written. You explained the problems of the Jacksonian era with good organization. Good explaination of the North and South and the types of work the took on. Good job on the simtopia and the argument behind it. Enjoyed reading your blog very insightful.</p>

			<p>Your post was very in detail and interesting to read. I liked how you even broke in down into fine detail about who is going to run what in your utopia. I thought it was a nice idea to have the church/government building right in the middle of the town. It will be accessible to everyone in the town, and it was the heart of the town. Overall your post was nice and I cant think of one thing to change.</p>

			<p>The description and structure you provided in your post really made it interesting. It was interesting to read about the process of how the leader is elected. The problems you addressed about the Jacksonian era were well written and made sense. The clarity of the way you wrote your post really helped in understanding what you were trying to get across and it seems as if you covered all the important issues in your utopia. Good post and nice utopia.</p>

			<p>I really liked how you gave insight into the problems that people faced in the Jacksonian Era. This made it very clear as to what your Utopia needed to accomplish. Even though this was part of the post guidelines, explaining these problems made your post stand out because many of the other bloggers failed to do so. I also like how you reason and gave explanations to why you made your utopia the way you did, and for the most part I cant think of any arguments against them. </p>
<p>On the other hand, I don’t think you should have only one church/religion. You cannot force everyone within a community to believe in something. Having more than one accepted religion would increase the number of people that are faithful to their religion and therefore less people would cause problems. Also, I am not sure if it would be a good idea to have a government owned store that distributes merchandise as part of salary. This is because other businesses that have the same merchandise might struggle to compete with government prices. Also, by having the government do this, it disrupts the perceived confidence that the government has in its paper money and thus furthers the problem.</p>

			<p>I have to agree with pretty much everyone about how descriptive your utopia is. It&#8217;s very easy for me to invision it without even having to look at the picture. I also like that you talked about the problems in the Jacksonian Era and related them to your utopia, not many others did this. It helped me to understand why certain things are the way they are in your utopia. For example, when you talked about the government allowing people to recieve goods instead of paper money, that was a good solution to the problem of paper money not being as trusted during this time.</p>
<p>Although I agree with some of the others that a one religion would be hard to accomplish, I would assume only people from that religion would want to live there. However, if someone from another background decided they wanted to live in your community, I am curious as to how you would handle that. Overall I think your utopia is very well addressed to the issues of the time period.</p>

			<p>I have to say I like the vision you have for your Utopia. I have a clear picture of it in my head. You did a very good job explaining your simutiopa. It was very detailed and well written, even though it is quite different than my utopia. I still agree on your concepts you want to bring together in your utopia. I like how you went about describing the Jacksonian Era and comparing it to your community. I thought you did a great job by doing that.<br />
However I do not agree with everyone practicing one religion. Overtime you will have people who will rebel. I think I could be the downfall of your community if everyone were to practicing one religion.<br />
Overall, your post was very intriguing, and very well written. It was very easy to follow along. Good post.</p>

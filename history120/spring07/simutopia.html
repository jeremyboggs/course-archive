				<p><strong>In my <a title="utopia" href="http://flickr.com/photos/56425041@N00/404382099/">utopia</a>, I plan to provide everything for the people living there, with the option to expand; there will never be involuntary unemployment, the crime rate will be minimal, and the residents will generally be in the same socioeconomic class.</strong></p>
<p>The houses in Amical are all in one general area, so that the residents will be able to get to know each other  and be able to help each other out easily.  The houses are, however, spaced out just enough so that the families will be able get their privacy and not have to worry about the neighbors looking through their windows and stuff like that.  The same holds true with the factories and public buildings; they are all grouped together with others like it.  Where people live, work, and hang out are all in separate areas.  While at work, the workers won&#8217;t be able to look out the window and see the shops and start day dreaming.  In order for factory made goods to be readily available all the time, the productivity rate must be excellent.  So that is why the factories are pretty far away from the shops.  But if factory work isn&#8217;t for you, then there will always be jobs available at the shops.  The park is also nearby the shops so that you can get some quiet time in while running errands or if you just need to get away from everyday life.</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome, and we don&#8217;t discriminate.  Every house comes with the means to support the family living there: fields, orchards, woods, and easy access to the river.  I plan to end unemployment in the community by offering work to both men and women at the factory to the people working there.  If the factories were to become crowded, there is plenty of nearby land to build another one.  Any disturbances or breaking of the laws will be solved by the police department, which works with the judicial system.  Depending on who moves into the town, religion may or may not be a major component of our society.  The majority of the residents will also choose which religion to practice at the church.  We will have a governor, who is elected by the people, who will be in charge of the town.  The governor would also have a board of supervisors under him who will keep him in check while making decisions and passing laws.  We want a set up like that so our governor does not receive too much power, or aspire to gain total control.  The wealth will be distributed pretty evenly, since everyone has everything they need to live, and an equal chance of work at the factory.  Although the life style is not lavish, people will live contently and will never have to go without everyday necessities and comforts.  For instance, our people will never miss a meal because they either don&#8217;t have the means to make one or cannot afford one.  Drinking will also be strictly prohibited, which will be strongly enforced by the police department.  Hopefully, this will help increase morale and production rate, while lowering the crime rate.</p>
<p>My goal for this community will be to establish  an effective town in which people will have the freedom to provide for themselves, or choose to pay for the things that they need.  Alcoholism will not be a problem, so there would be no reason for alcohol to provide unproductive behavior.  Women&#8217;s rights will be honored with their equal opportunity to employment, if they choose to work.  I plan for Amical to be the ideal place to live, where everyone could live contently.</p>

			<p>First I must say that you did a fantastic job coloring your map. Eliminating alcohol completely and haveing a strong crackdown on it seems to be a good idea. The only potential problem I see is your religion structure. If the majority get the church, one would assume that they would also have the most power in this town. This could lead to inequities with the minority religion(s).</p>

			<p>The layout of the town seems to be fairly logical.  Placing the houses far enough apart for people to not feel too crowded in is a very good idea becasue it allows people to feel that they have a place to get away from it all.  Keeping the people happy is essential in preventing social unrest.  Making alcohol consumption illegal may not be a good idea because it supresses individuals rights, and this in turn could cause discontent among the populous.</p>

			<p>I loved your post! We had a couple things in common. I too separated my factories and public buildings from near the homes. I think we both thought of it as a way for privacy and relaxation. It is an added bonus to not have to hear the machinery from your house! I thought you included some really interesting facts. I like how you are trying to create this place that everybody can be happy with. You talk about allowing both men and women to work and freedom of religion. </p>
<p>My favorite part of your post was your actual simutopia. I like how you added in all those colors. It makes it not so boring to look at it! I also liked how you talked about every single detail involved in your community to really create this simutopia. It actually sounds very appealing to me! If I had to make one criticism on you post, it would be that I would rethink your no alcohol thing. It might arise some problems with people in the community. Other than that., loved it!</p>

			<p>Your map is nicely filled in and paints a picture of a pretty and productive town.  I would characterize your utopia a socialist democracy.  On the surface this seems like a fair and just society where everyone is equal and lives happily.  The problem I see is with the protection of minority rights.  In your essay you state that the dominant religion will control the church.  History would dictate that the governor would most likely come from that dominant religion, and without something like the Constitution to ensure the rights of the minority, there would be nothing to stop the majority from using democracy to impose their religious views on the minority or minorities.  This is a detail America’s founding fathers did not over look, if you are to reference Federalist Paper #51 written by James Madison he states that, “If a majority be united by a common interest, the rights of the minority will be insecure” this is why he goes on to propose “the security of civil rights”.  To amend this all your utopia would have to do is create a rock solid separation of church and state and a set of inalienable rights.  Also the idea of outlawing drinking to alleviate crime is not a good one.  One only has to look back a prohibition and the rise of the mob in the 1920&#8217;s to come the realization that outlawing certain things like alcohol sometimes can lead to more problems.</p>

			<p>I like this Utopia and I think it has a lot of good ideas. It is really good that unemployment won&#8217;t be an issue because everyone should be able to get a job if they want to. So that was a really good idea to give everyone and equal opportunity basically to work if they wanted to. Another big plus is that there is no discrimination in your community. That is a problem that has been present throughout history and being able to get rid of it will greatly improve life in your community. </p>
<p>The thing I see wrong is if you provide everything for the people, which I&#8217;m guessing includes money, then what is going to motivate these people to want to work in factories if they already get money? I know that if I lived in a place that provided everything for me then I wouldn&#8217;t want to work. I guess I can see that you could say that if you don&#8217;t work then no money will be made and the Utopia would fall apart and everything would be gone. I guess I still have a problem with providing money to everyone instead of making them earn in a paycheck.</p>

			<p>I enjoyed reading your ideas i thought they were very interesting and you goal was very different. Preventing alcohol was the good intention, but mightt cause many other problems to the community. Equality was a good direction, and eliminating unemployment would be a great thing to accomplish. I had o nly one problem, when you mentioned the freedom of religion, you stated that they will choose their religion in the church. Wouldn&#8217;t this cause a dilemma to the smaller religions</p>

			<p>You really took some time on this post considering that you COLORED your map. Wow! That really helped distinguish bewtween   roads and bridges; as well as factories and farms. You did something different in your towm than i did in mine; it seems that you are an agriculterally based society. most of your factories are surrounded by farmland and woods. I put in my Utopia more of an industry based society. I felt that it would bring in more revenue, and the town would prosper better. My last comment is on your policy of no alcohol. What are you doing not allowing alcohol. If used in moderation it could ease the stress of working those long hard days. Everything else was great but sometimes you just need to relax.</p>

			<p>After looking at your utopia, I can truly tell how much time and effort you spent on this post just by seeing all the coloring.  Awesome job with that!  Also, I liked how you set up your utopia having all the wealth mainly being distrubuted equally.  This is an extremely good idea and is something I would put in my communtiy as well because it will make the communty more peaceful.  Instead of all the competition about whose making more money and who has the better jobs, the community will be focusing on other things like how I can improve this job and how I can make this community better.  It will also prevent a lot of fighting.  I also liked how you included equal right&#8217;s for women.  I believe that every community should have equal right&#8217;s for women.  I mean why shouldn&#8217;t women have equal right&#8217;s?  They deserve to work and get the same respect as do the female&#8217;s.  </p>
<p>The only problem I see and other&#8217;s do as well is the banning alcohol.  I don&#8217;t think this is a very good idea.  Granted, alcohol can bring out very bad results, but the worker&#8217;s deserve to have some fun.  I think if you put back in alcohol, the worker&#8217;s would be a lot less stressed and look forward to the night after a long day&#8217;s work.</p>

			<p>I like how you allow people to choose their religion, or even choose to have one.  This avoids conflicts because many people will believe in different terms than others.  Similarly, my utopian community isn&#8217;t luxurious or &#8220;lavish&#8221;.  I agree that as long as they have their necessities in life they will be content.  My community is also equal in their social status.  There is no rich or poor because everyone has the same amount of wealth.  I built my community so that on one side of the river the community focuses on agriculture, and the other side has public buildings and holds town meetings.  This way, these different cultures will learn to share and provide for each other and their families.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t like how you stated there will be no windows for the residents while they are working.  I know it is important to focus on being productive in order to be successful, but that should be to an extent.  It sounds almost as if work for your people seems tedious like labor.  I believe everyone should enjoy their jobs.  As long as the people enjoy what they do, being productive will come along with it.</p>

			<p>I agree with productivity to ensure that the town runs smoothly. I also agree with having people under the governor making sure that he is in check. The fact the houses and the factories are far apart does help keep work and home seperate.<br />
I did not like the fact that you have a choice to work. I know I would not work if I didnt have to, especially if I would still benefit from others who did work, this would inturn create a nonsocioeconomic commmunity. Another idea I did not agree with was the fact that the police and judges were in the same system. It does not create a fair checks and balances to me. The last thing I did not agree with was the fact that alcohol was banded. I do not agree with banning very much because it makes people want to do it more. Another example of prohibition not working is the fact that we tried it before and it did not last very long. I do not believe prohibition will effect productivity as much as thought. I believe you had a VERY well written blog and this is all opinion, so neither answer is right, just some comments as to what I feel may work!</p>

			<p>For the most part your town seems like a nice place to live. I don&#8217;t agree with what you wrote about for work since you make it seem like a person can work if they want to, but doesnt have to. I also don&#8217;t think prohibitng the use of alcohol would do your town well. I think it would actually raise your crime rate becuase of smugglers and people making moonshine. Prohibition didn&#8217;t work before so i honestly don&#8217;t think it would work again.</p>

			<p>I really enjoyed read your post, I think this is very good post and I like a lot. After read your blog, I have a lot of thought about how to make better city for people live. The main thing about your simutopia is everyone will have safe place to live. Equality was a good direction, and eliminating unemployment would be a great thing to accomplish.  However, your town didn’t have economics. I think money is very important factor.  A town can not run it without good economics; people always go to the richest place for living. Preventing alcohol was the good thing for the community, but it might also cause many other problems to the community. I really like your picture, and how you make your picture so nice. You also add color into picture even make better.</p>

			<p>I like that you emphasize privacy and the seperation of work and home, although I do not agree with doing this to take away from worktime &#8220;day dreaming&#8221; I do feel as though this seperation could keep crime away from homes not to mention pollution and the heaviest of the traffic. No alcohol? Come on now, I do not agree with these kind of restrictions. Yes, alcohol can cause problems but problems are not solved by oppressing just one factor. If people want to have alcohol in the community they will eventually, whether there are laws against it or not. We have seen this in history with more substances than just alcohol. I firmly believe that people should be have and be trusted with responsibility, as long as peoples desires are being oppressed (whether they be alcohol or sex or what have you) there will not be a society free of discrepancies</p>

			<p>No alcohol?  This seems to be a main theme in all the utopias.  I wouldn&#8217;t mind having a drink after a long day, working in a building that has no windows.  Having factories as a work place without any windows would seem to lower morale and decrease productivity.  It was a good idea on paper, but probably wouldn&#8217;t work when taken into action.  Every utopia has there own take on religion.  I liked how you made a decision that the majority would decide which religion to practice in the church.  Though this will most likely create hostility and jealously from the less popular religions, other churches can be built to accomodate those.<br />
You make it sound like working in the factory is the minimum wage job, since it is so far away from the rest of society, while the shops are close to home and people can relax.  Having the fields around the houses to provide food and other needs is also a good idea, but who is going to grow that food around the houses and are there sections in the fields so that each house has there own supply?  You have a bunch of great ideas that look good on paper, but I don&#8217;t know if they would work in real life.  I guess that&#8217;s why utopias don&#8217;t exist.</p>

			<p>You did a good job planning the layout of your utopia. I think that it is smart for the work and leisure areas to be separated, and that peoples living situations are not too crowded. Not only will the extra space between houses make people happier, but it will also reduce the risk of disease or plague. </p>
<p>But, who decides which people work at the shops and which people work in the factories? If the shops are a desired place to spend free time, then you would probably assume that everyone would want to work there as well. Also, if goods are readily available at all times, what incentive to people have to work hard as individuals? It would have been good if you thought about these types of things. Also, I think it would be a much better idea make alcohol forbidden by their religion, rather than using police force, which could lead to rebellion. Overall, I think you had some good ideas.</p>

			<p>Your Utopia sounds a lot like the one I created. I too put my houses far from the factories so that one might not be reminded of work while at home or of home while at work (to prevent day dreaming). I also agree that one should not HAVE to work haha. How though will everyone be provided for? What if no one decides to work? I would not work if I knew I didn&#8217;t have to but could still be fed.<br />
The topic of no alcohol has its pros and cons. Basically I agree it is better without alcohol. The presence of it could decrease productivity if mixed with work, but on the other hand it is a means of relaxation and escape. However, other recreational activities would be created with prohibiton. It would be for the betterment of the community to do without alcohol.</p>

			<p>The design for your simtopia was well thought out. I enjoyed reading the your plans and ideas on how to run it as well. The explanation about having the same social class was a good touch. The spacing of the houses and and a mayor with not too much power were all good points. Well done, I think you did a great job on this blog.</p>

Making sure that equality was present in the utopia was also a good idea along with the idea of fighting off unemployment. I think you did a good job on your post.</p>

			<p>I enjoyed reading your post and the layout of your simutopia. The colors gave it life and you could actually see how things looked all together. I thought it was a good idea to ban alcohol, I personally think that alcohol is the source to most of the problems in life and the community. I also thought it was very clever to keep everything close  enough to get around, but far enough so you have privacy. The idea of making everything that you need and everything else you can get at the local store was also a good idea. Overall your post was well written and interesting to read.</p>

			<p>I think your utopia has lots of good idea. The fact that you mentioned the goal to have zero unemployment and how you described providing jobs for anyone who needs one in the factories, I think is a good plan. Also, how you talked about having the police department work with the judicial system, seems very effective. Some of the other blogs either didn&#8217;t mention law enforcement or said it wasn&#8217;t needed, which I don&#8217;t think would work in any community. I also really liked how you colored the utopia. It made it much easier to distinguish and just looked better overall.</p>
<p>I agree that prohibition would be hard to accomplish. But afterall, it is your town! Just the fact that it had such widespread failure in the 20&#8217;s makes me curious as to how you would actually inforce this law throughout the community.</p>

			<p>There were many things I liked about your post and your map. I liked the distance between the factories, businesses, and housing (which I tend to think is always a plus). I also liked that nobody would be forced to work, and that the majority of people would be on the same socioeconomic plain. However, the idea of abolishing alcohol, as you discussed, would be a very hard thing to do. I don&#8217;t know if the benefits would outway the costs, which is something to think about.</p>

			<p>I really liked this post. I definitely agree with you on your utopia. My utopia is somewhat but not completely similiar, to yours. I think you did a great job explaining your community. I think you picked good things to focus your community on.<br />
I also like how you made your simutopia. The colors made it merrier. It kind of gave me a sense what your community would look like if it were a real community.<br />
Overall your post was very interesting and it is by far my favorite utopia. Excellent post.</p>

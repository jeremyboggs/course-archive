			<div class="entry">
				<p><strong>    Mulatto slaves had very useful skills and were considered exceptionally valuable.</strong> The chances of escape as a Mulatto Slave where enhanced due to his or her color. As a Mulatto slave, chances of escape where increased since the skin color resembled that of Native Americans. As explained in many advertisements resembling Indians as appose to African American slaves made chances of escape much greater. As many Mulatto slaves disguised themselves as Indians wearing match coats and other Indian apparel, increasing their chances of escape and hiding out amongst Black Indians. Many where found hiding in forests and other wooded areas as they attempted to pass themselves off as Black Indians. It appears that the runaways had to be witty and cunning to portray themselves as freed slaves or a Black Indians.</p>
<p>These ads tell us a great deal about the courage and resilience these men and women had during these times of hardship. Some advertisements had warnings explaining how difficult it was to catch certain slaves. Many would escape again from the slave trackers or would not allow themselves to surrender or be taken alive. These advertisements help show us the mentality and courage of the runways. It took a strong willed person to run-a-way from is his or her master, as these slaves did not know what was waiting for them on the road to freedom. Many Mulatto slaves had acquired skills which were vital to plantations such as carpentry, farming, taming horses, and medicine. Some owners where willing to pay up to two hundred dollars for the return of their runaway slave. At that time that amount of money would equal big bucks today. It is clear that in having such skills as carpentry or horse taming a lot of these slaves could be earning good money as freed slaves.</p>
<p>In most advertisements it seems as if the slave owners are showcasing the talents of the runaway slaves. The way certain texts are written makes it appear as if the slaves made a bad choice and just needed to find there way back to the plantation. They disguise the fact that a human is owned by another human. The Mulatto slaves had a better chance of escape due to their mixed color and their ability to take advantage of that. This history lesson shows us that when people are treated unjustly, they will find ways to rise above it.</p>

			<p>Living as a slave was hard for any group that was forced to endear it. You talked about how talented the slaves were and how they brought so much to the plantation that they worked on. I agree with you. I think that because of this fact, that slaves were so skilled and hard-working, that the colonists were afraid of them. I mean “afraid” in the sense that they knew that if enough of them got away, then there would be some sort of rebellion or revolt and the slaves would then over power the colonists. I think that also has to do with the fact that they listed all the runaway’s talents in the advertisements. It may have been better if somebody else had the slave, than the slave being free! </p>
<p>   Your paper actually showed me a lot. I thought you raised some very interesting points, such as, “these advertisements help show us the mentality and courage of the runways.” When I looked at the ads, I never really looked at it in the perspective. Instead, I just looked at it in the sense that they were just looking for a way out, for freedom. Though you showed me that it was more than that for them, it wasn’t easy and took a lot of courage and strength. Though in your paper, I wish you would have spent a little more time discussing the Mulatto slaves. I sort of got confused in the middle of your paper as to whether you were discussing all slaves or Mulatto slave in particular. Other than that, I enjoyed it!</p>

			<p>Until reading this blog, I had not realized that their were so many mulatto occurances back in the days of slavery. It seems to be that although slaves were thought of to be property, it does not seem as if they actually felt that way. I did not realize that due to the mixed race they could say they were Native Americans. Before I read your blog, I had not realized that mulatto slaves formed tribes to say that they were Native Americant. I thought forming tribes was an ingenious idea.<br />
Although your article was excellent there was a problem i found with the thesis statement. Most slaves were talented in a form of work, yet your thesis statement makes me feel as if only mulatto slaves were skilled because they were lighter skinned.  I read an advertisment, written by Henry Lee, that said that the runaway mulatto slaves were likely trying to head toward Philadelphia. This was likely because the slave had tryed to escape before. Although some mulatto slaves had tried to play themselves off as Native Americans, I do not belive that they were many.<br />

			<p>Your paper is very interesting.  Before reading this blog comment, I had real know interest in Mullato slaves nor did I know what they were capable of doing through the slavery era.  I thought it was very interesting how you ended it when you said that &#8220;the history lesson shows us that when people are treated unjustly, they will find ways to rise above it.&#8221;  Having reading this comment and your blog post, I truly believe now that slaves worked for their freedom and the Mulatto slave is a true example of that.</p>
<p>The only problem that I had about your paper was the thesis statement.  A thesis statement is an argument that should be argued throughout your whole entire paper and it just seemed that there were only a few comments that argued how the Mulatto slaves had advantages to help their ways of living and they were only in the introduction.  Other than that small thing, it was great!!  Good Job!!</p>

			<p>When I looked at the assignment paper that was given out in class I thought this would be easy research. But as I went online I did not find a lot of information solely on Mulatto slaves. But what I did come across where a couple of web pages that did in fact support what you have said about the slaves being able to escape more easily because of their appearance. Different “costumes” if you will where used, such as becoming and Indian and literally walking out of the town to freedom. But your statement about there will to fight, I believe was in every slave not just the Mulatto slaves. If you were made to work long days I think you would definitely fight till death before going back as well.</p>
<p>One over critique I had was on your writing style. In the intro paragraph you kept saying “increased chances of escape”, you said it about 5 times in one paragraph, next time try to used different words or add new information. Over all I thought you paper was very informative.</p>

			<p>This article was very inciteful.  I never thought about the advantages Mulatto slaves must have had in their attempts to escape to freedom.  The idea of blending in with the local Native Americans is a clever one, and at the same time shows a lot of courage.  Thus, your blog offers a very nice anecdote to an otherwise terrible chapter in our history. Also you did a good thing in reminding us of the skills acquired by slaves and of the fact that they were far more than grunt manual labors, as they are often portrayed.</p>
<p>Looking more critically at this posting, I would submit that the thesis of your blog needs some work.  Although it is relatively well writen as far as grammer and content is concerned, your thesis does not appear to hold up to scrutiny.  Your thesis, as well as the title of your blog, implies that Mulatto slaves were somehow more valuable than a typical slave.  This assertion is not self-evident.  I do not know why Mulatto slaves would provide some sort of additional value to the slaveowner.  Consequently, the assertion must be explained and evidence should be offered to support it.  Your posting, however, does not provide any evidence for this claim, and the reader is left to his own devices to figure why (or whether) this central assertion is valid.</p>

I would like to say after reading your comment and re-reading my blog I do not see where i say that the Mulatto slaves where more valuable. If that was what you understood after reading my blog, that was not my intentions. The point I was trying to make was that Slaves in general were valuable, with the skills they possesed. Second point I was trying to make was that as being Mulatto they could disguise themselves as black indians who had similar skin tone.</p>

			<p>I noted in your second paragraph that you talked about the &#8220;great deal of courage&#8221; the slaves had during this time period. I wrote this off as false sticking up the &#8220;desperate times call for desperate measures&#8221; cliché until I pulled up one of the adds posted which said. &#8220;I expect he will change his dress, as he carried off with him at least 200 pounds cash.&#8221; Any fool can get up and run, but this one in particular had the balls to steal a considerable amount of money before leaving. That is courage.</p>
<p>Some criticisms. Your thesis does imply that Mulatto slaves were more valuable than other slaves, and then was not backed up by much. Also, it was hard to tell if you were talking about Mulatto slaves or slaves in general throughout the blog.</p>

			<p>I think your paper has an interesting topic, mulatto slaves. I did not notice there were mulatto salves at that time. It is new information to me. When I imagined slaves, I could only think of African Americans before I read your paper. I was also very interested in the fact that due to skin color of  mulatto, they pretended like native Americans when they escaped. Like you said in your paper, I think that mulatto salves had better chance of escape if they could disguise themselves as Indians.</p>
<p>In your paper, you said that mulatto salves had very useful skills and exceptionally valuable. I agree with the idea that some slaves had skills and slaves with talent were more worth than the others. I also believe that slaves had knowledge of some skills such as blacksmith, carpentry, and farming.  However, your title and thesis make me feel like only mulatto salves had skills. I think that not only mulatto salves were talented and valuable but also other African salves.<br />
	Overall I really enjoyed reading your paper. You have interesting point, and I learned a lot. “This history lesson shows us that when people are treated unjustly, they will find ways to rise above it.” was my favorite sentence in your writing.</p>

			<p>I agree with many of the other comments regaurding not having previously known about Mulatto slaves. I had no idea they were so common or that anyone really distinguished between a Mulatto or an African American slave. I also found it very interesting that slaves tried to pass themselves off as Native Americans to help themselves escape. It is very interesting to look into ways that slaves tried to escape and the different creative ways people can come with in order to escape injustice.</p>
<p>However, I do believe your blog is a little unorganized. Usually it is more common to build up to the thesis a bit rather than directly stating the thesis with no evidence. I agree with some of the others that your thesis sounds like Mulatto slaves were considered more valuable than others. If that is in fact true, you did not provide proof in your blog. So maybe you can re-word the thesis or add in some evidence that better supports your claim.</p>
<p>I did enjoy reading it though and got a lot of information out of it!</p>

			<p>After reading your blog, I learned more about the mulatto slave. For instance, I did not know that runaway mulatto slaves tried to disguise themselves as “Black Indians.” This fact is one that catches my attention because it makes perfect sense. How do you tell between the two? Chameleons in the wild use camouflage as a defensive mechanism in order to not be attacked by their prey. In the case of the mulatto runaway we can compare them to the chameleon in the way that these runaways used a form of disguise in order to not be captured. The art of disguise is one of the oldest techniques used among living things to travel without being detected. Common sense you figure, yet I would have never known that this was going on with these mulatto runaways until I read this blog. Great Job!</p>
<p>I enjoyed reading your post it definitely opened my eyes to the way of survival that these runaways had to endure; however, I was kind of confused in parts of your blog. You talk about the way the mulatto slaves were more valuable and more skillful on the plantations. I do not agree. I feel that this argument is false. Just because these slaves were mulattos it did not give them certain skills or value level. There skills come from a variety of circumstances in their development and are simply unknown from these advertisements.</p>

			<p>After reading this article, I agree with you that slaves could actually make a decent living by the skills that they have. Wherever the slaves came from, they also needed the skills to survive and with the skills that they have, they can basically do anything with it as long as they didn’t get caught by their owners. Without their slaves, the owners would be hopeless and I wouldn’t think that they can get anything done because the slaves have been doing everything for them since the beginning. From the slave’s point of view, I would think that it will be hard to earn good money because I would think that their owner would be looking for them everywhere.</p>
<p>This article has taught me a lot about slaves that I never knew about. I was surprised that the some of the slaves disguised themselves as someone else and actually escaped. For all the information that I have learned in school about slaves, this is something very new to me. It takes a lot of courage for the slaves to come up with a great idea because if they ever got caught, then terrible things would be done to the slaves. Even though the Mulatto slaves had a very high chance of escaping, it’s a shame that the other slaves couldn’t escape and if they did, their chances were low.</p>

			<p>This is very interesting blog. After reading your blog, you said slave were very skill and hard working. I agree with you 100%. I think slaves were very important in USA history; also they were very important in world history too. Slaves were very skill that the owner couldn’t lose them, because they need those slaves’ works for them, so they can make money. There is a lot of information about mulatto slaves, which I don’t learn from my other assignment. Also I found something I don’t really agree with you. You said mulatto slaves were very easy to escape, I don’t think it will be easy for them. If they were so skill, the owner will do everything they could to stop them escape. Over all, this is very good blog, l learned a lot from your blog, and I enjoyed it.</p>

			<p>The point you brought up about Mulatto slaves&#8217; chances of escape increased was very interesting, I had never thought about them before like that. When i think of the term &#8220;slave&#8221; even if it is used after the word &#8220;Mulatto&#8221;, I automatically think of them as a person from full African descent and not someone that can disguise themselves as native americans and run away. It shows how badly they were mistreated that they would risk escaping from their &#8220;masters&#8221; as you would call them since they controlled their life. However, I agree to what some have said above me, they were not more valuable and have those skills just because they were Mulatto slaves but because that was probably what they were trained for.<br />
All in all, this post was very good and written very well because it added information to what we already talked about in class about slaves running away from their masters and how they would put articles up giving rewards for whoever found them. They are very valuable.</p>

			<p>I thought this article was researched well and provided some informational facts that might be overlooked when we learn about slaves. I liked the point about how Mulatto slaves had a better chance of escape because their skin color was lighter. It seemed that Mulatto slaves had such a better chance of escape because they could blend in better with the people. Since most of the Mulatto slaves that ran away blended in better, that their skills could be used to provide a living as a free slave. I thought that was a good point and was very insightful.<br />
In general I thought the article was very informing and had a lot of good ideas to it. I guess my critique would be maybe provide some more ads to get information from. Maybe just gather some more information about Mulatto slaves from any site about them to argue your point better. I&#8217;m sure there is other stuff on Mulatto slaves that could of been put into the article to show more about them. I kind of started to look so I could post a website to link, but I stopped. Just my take on it.</p>

			<p>Your article on the Mulatto slaves was very informative.  I hate history, I have had it every year starting with elementary school. However, learning about slavery and reading about facts leading up the Civil War has always interested me the most. I have read a lot about that time period and I cannot recall at this moment much said about the Mulatto slaves. I enjoyed finally reading and learning about something in history that I havent already been taught. I just hope I can remember it.  You seemed to have researched the topic well and you knew what you were writing about.  I would consider it a very good blog post.</p>

			<p>I learned a lot from reading your post about Mulatto slaves.  I didn&#8217;t even know such slaves existed so it was an interesting read.  It is amazing how some slaves had the privilege to disguise themselves as Indians.  The different tone of their skin helped set themselves apart from the rest of the slaves.   I enjoyed reading about their talents, and how they were almost treasured for it.  I also agree that the slaves who chose to escape showed much courage and determination in their character.  These run-away slaves were courageous fighters for freedom and their own independence.  Mulatto slaves had an advantage, but also seemed to have these powerful characteristics.  Even though they could have easily disguised themselves, they were still risking their lives to escape.</p>
<p>It is sad how these slaves have to go to such extremes to live a normal and justified life by hiding their own identity.  I thought you could have described the ads you have chosen in your body paragraph to get more in depth about why you specially chose each ad.  Overall, I enjoyed reading your blog.  You have taught me something new.  Mulatto slaves should most definitely be honored for their courage and perseverance.</p>

			<p>I had heard of the term &#8220;mulatto&#8221; before, but I was no too familiar with what exactly it was all about. Your post helped me to understand what mulatto slaves did and how they used their skin color to their advantage in trying to gain freedom from slavery. I also agree that they had valuable skills which they could use to gain income and also some could be used to survive.</p>
<p>One critique I have is that the words &#8220;chances of escape&#8221; were used to frequently close together. It made the beginning part of the post sound very redundant.</p>

			<p>You learn something new every day.  I truly had no idea that Mulatto people were enslaved.  I thought African Americans were the people enslaved.  I found it quite interesting that the Mulatto people would go out and join Native Americans to try to escape their masters, however this brings up a question in my mind.  Did the Native Americans welcome and except the Mulatto people, or did they reject them?  It really impresses me that these slaves were so daring and witty.  I assume that in order for them to escape and stay hidden, they had to make an extensive plan.</p>
<p>I will agree with many of these posts in saying your thesis does make it seem that only Mulatto slaves had valuable skills, but it is just in how you wrote it that it gives off that appearance.</p>

			<p>It is very interesting, and you are very right, that it seems like the slave owners are writing these ads in a manner that makes it seem as if the slave is lost and just needs to “come home.” For example, the ad that we read in class from Thomas Jefferson, Jefferson made it seem like he actually knew this slave and was friends with him. He even mentioned what the slave was like when drunk. Also, it makes me wonder why the slave owners making these ads state what hard workers the slaves are. I mean, if I were to find this hardworking slave, I would keep him for myself and put him to work. He could be more valuable as a worker than they money I would get for him. In the Goddard ad that you found, he does the same thing. Goddard stated that the slave was a “very handy ingenious fellow” and a good cradler. Why would he “brag” about how good he was? </p>
<p>I also learned from this post how many Mulatto slaves there actually were. When I think black slave, I think exactly that…a black slave, not a mix of white and black. The people back then thought white was supreme, why would they beat and work someone almost like them? I also found it interesting that the Mulattos could hide amongst the Indians. Did the Indians approve of this? I do not think that they would. Even though Indians were a somewhat peaceful folk, they do not seem to accept outsiders who force themselves into their world. </p>
<p>It makes me wonder what happened to the ones that escaped. How courageous these people must have been. If they were caught escaping, they would have been punished severely. Your post had taught me some things and made me think a little. However, your thesis states that the slaves are valuable, but you never mentioned why they were valuable. I believe you focus too much on them living with the Indians and not too much on other aspects of a Mulatto slave.</p>

			<p>When I read this post, it was the first time that I have even thought about escaping mulatto slaves.  It never even occurred to me that a mulatto slave, different in skin color from more recognizable slaves, had a better chance of escaping since he or she looked more like a free person than a slave.  You mentioned that in your blog post that the slave owners who wrote the ads seemed to have been &#8220;showcasing the talents of the runaway slaves.&#8221;  In class we went over the Thomas Jefferson ad and came to the conclusion that he knew that particular slave very well.  It could have been to showcase their talents but another reason could have been just to make it easier to locate them and bring them back for a reward.  If the runaway mulatto slaves ran away once, what is stopping them from running away from a different owner if they are captured and not returned.  The people who captured the slaves would most likely just take the sure thing, the money, instead of having to deal with a trouble-maker.</p>
<p>I disagree with the slaves made a &#8220;bad choice&#8221; argument.  There was obviously a reason why the slave became a runaway.  Since it was more difficult to locate a mulatto slave due to their skin color, the slave made the decision that he or she had a better chance of surviving or living a better if they were a &#8220;freed&#8221; person and no longer had to work out in the field with very little benefit.  This is why they went into the whole trouble of dressing up as Indians in order for them to blend in even more.  But they would have to assimilate with the people that they disguised themselves as since, I assume, it would be difficult to locate other escaped slaves.  Is there a record of how many mulatto slaves successfully escaped?  It just leaves we wondering if they escaped mulatto slaves actually continued living as freed people or they had to go back since they could not survive on their own.</p>

			<p>Until reading your post, I, as well as many of the others in class based on their posts, did not realize that mulattos were as common as they were. I often assumed most slaves were not mixed, because it is hard for me to fathom that if the slaves were mixed, and therefore offspring of the slave owners, that they would then make their own children act as slaves. However, I can see why it would be easier for them to escape from slavery than it would be for a slave that was not mixed. What I don&#8217;t understand is why their skills would be more valuable than a non-mixed slave. It seems to me that both mulattos and non-mixed slaves would have similar skills, and therefore one would not be more valuable over another.</p>

			<p>When reading your post, I felt like you had some insightful remarks. For example, I liked the fact that you looked deep into the personalities and mentalities of the slaves and slave owners. Instead of simply showing that the slaves wanted to escape, and the slave owners wanted to get their property back, you analyzed the ads and realized that it must have taken great courage and resilience for the slaves to evade their owners. In regard to the mentality of the slave owners, I agree with your statement that sometimes “They disguise the fact that a human is owned by another human”. By doing so, the slave owner portrays the slave as human rather than property, which may encourage someone to return them instead of keeping them for themselves.<br />
On the other hand, there were some aspects of your post that could be improved. First of all, I felt like you reiterated yourself over and over just to make your text seem longer. You could have made the same points in a more concise manner. Also, I wish that you had focused more on why Mulatto slaves were “exceptionally” more valuable compared to normal slaves. You wrote that “Many Mulatto slaves had acquired skills which were vital to plantations such as carpentry, farming, taming horses, and medicine”, but according to some of the Ads that I read, so did fully African slaves. If you had explained why or how Mulattos were more skilled, you would have backed up your thesis statement, which would have made your post much stronger.</p>

			<p>I found it interesting that you chose to write about Mulatto slaves, since they are probably the least heard about. I didn&#8217;t even realize that they could pass off as Native Americans, so I thought that was interesting too. But I don&#8217;t think that you should single out the Mulatto slaves as knowing the important skills or talents, because there&#8217;s no evidence proving that just the Mulattoes had those skills. But I am glad that you talked about these specific slaves, since I had basically had no clue about them before.</p>

			<p>Your post on Mulatto slaves was very interesting. Grammatically the paper was very well written. It flowed easily and had good transitions. The information you gave was very interesting. Many times people think of all slaves as having no freedom and no rights. Your illustration of mulatto slaves showed that certain individuals had the ability to disguise themselves, to escape from such horrible conditions. Also, many mulatto slaves were given more skilled crafts which enabled them to have a slightly better chance of escaping, compared to full African slaves. </p>
<p>The one part of the article that I think might have been a little wrong was about the slave owners “showcasing” their slaves, and trying to hide the fact that they had slaves. During that period of time owning slaves was not seen as a socially unacceptable institution. On the contrary, people who did not own slaves were either to poor to afford them or did own land. Furthermore, I do not think that with the cost of slaves, people would try and showcase their slaves. I think that would draw unwanted attention.</p>

			<p>This essay written on Mulatto was very interesting. By learning the different characteristics of a Mulatto slave, how they were considered more valuable, helps to understand why slave owners went to such great lengths to try to find and capture them. Also, by learning about the complexion of a Mulatto slave I also understood easier how the slaves were easier to escape. I would make the assumption another possible reason slave owners were so anxious to catch them was because they recognized that these slaves were smarter than the average and possibly more capabable of organizing revolts and the latter.</p>
<p>There are two things I believe could improve this writing overall. First I believe that the thesis sentence was rather weak, I felt it was a good start to a thesis but should have had a little additional information to shed light on the topic being discussed as a whole. Second, as a writer I would try to add a little evidence to support the assumptions I made in the essay, such as yours on &#8217;showcasing&#8217; the slaves.</p>

			<p>I really enjoyed reading this post. There are many different viewpoints here that one usually isn&#8217;t presented with. I really like how you brought up how being a mulatto slave was different than being an African American slave when running away. This is even further illustrated through the wikipedia article I will post at the bottom, about the caste system which developed in Latin America which also included mulattos. I also like the way you noticed that the slave owners, within the ads, were trying to hide the fact that these slaves were owned by another. I&#8217;m still not sure though if this was due to  conscience or just trying to look good in the public eye.</p>
<p>The only problem with your post in my opinion is that you stray away from your thesis too much. I feel in order to be a truly effective post, it should contain most if not all information on just mulattos, but once again, your post was great to read.</p>

			<p>I think that you talked about how much easier it was for a mulatto slave to escape too much. You weren’t giving new information every time you said it was easier for them to escape, you just kept repeating in different ways how they could pull off being an Indian. It was an interesting fact to read about how slaves were even wiling to die as opposed to being brought back to their masters.</p>

			<p>Your post was quite informative. I would have never imagined that mulatto slaves would have advantages in order to escape to gain their freedom. It was much easier for them to escape the harsh life as slaves if they were able to disguise themselves as Native Americans. Wow, who would ever think of that? It didn&#8217;t even occur to me. Now that I think about it they definitely had an advantage over African American slaves.<br />
In your post, I would have to disagree with the part you mention that Mulatto slaves had useful skills and exceptionally valuable. I feel that not only would Mulatto slaves have useful skills but so would African American slaves. I don’t necessarily think that one would outweigh the other.<br />
Overall, your post was very informative. I never would have thought that Mulatto slaves would disguise themselves as Native Americans to gain their freedom. Very clever. I however think that your thesis was weak because you did not have much evidence backing it up. Otherwise it was a great post.</p>

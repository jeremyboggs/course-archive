				<p>Most of us at one time or another have heard about the Westboro Baptist Church.They are the radical group that calls themselves a church who go to the funerals of dead servicemen and protest with signs that say &#8220;God Hates Fags&#8221; etc. The &#8220;church&#8221; recruits its members from one family, it is a family operation. So the question is, is it time that America take away the children of these radicals. They cause them to experience great hate without every getting a choice in how they feel. I understand the debate between freedom of speech and hate speech, but these kids have been brainwashed. The Westboro Baptist church are a cult which brainwashes children to believing nothing but intense hate. They claim that they are warriors for God, but does it really sound like a true argument. How many groups have claimed this. America has now begun to enact laws that the Westboro baptists church must stay a certain distance away from all military funerals. Some reactionary groups, such as the freedom riders, ride motorcycles to the funerals and use the loud sound of the engines to drown out the protests. The families of the victims have said that the sound of the motorcycles is music to their ears over the hate speech. The freedom riders are truly a great group. It is time that America do something to abolish these groups that spread nothing but hate. Social Services should have taken these kids a long time ago and put themo in a better environment than these &#8220;God Warriors&#8221;</p>

<p>I believe that there are also some freedom riders in this video.</p>

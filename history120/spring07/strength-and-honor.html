				<p><strong>The film Gladiator creates a story where one Roman, Russel Crowe, goes from being a General of the Roman army to a slave forced to fight as a gladiator. The message of the movie seems to be that you can be on top of the world and have everything taken away from you. Gladiator This film definitely has good depictions of what happened in the arena&#8217;s in ancient Rome, but each arena scene also had some flaws within it.</p>
<p></strong>. The message of the movie seems to be that you can be on top of the world and have everything taken away from you. Gladiator This film definitely has good depictions of what happened in the arena&#8217;s in ancient Rome, but each arena scene also had some flaws within it.In Gladiator, the Roman Emperor&#8217;s son Commodus kills his father in order to gain power. He then orders Crowe&#8217;s character to be executed and his family murdered. Crowe escapes but his family don&#8217;t fair quite as well. When he returns to his home, he finds his family dead. Exhausted and wounded, he lies beside their bodies until some slavers pick him up. The slavers sell him to a man named Proximo who makes Crowe fight in an arena somewhere in the Roman Empire as a gladiator. Proximo brings his gladiators to Rome to fight in the Colosseum to fight in a series of events that Commodus planned. Crowe sees this as his opportunity for revenge. He wins every battle he is put in and defy&#8217;s Commodus in every way he can. In the end, Crowe winds up fighting Commodus in the Colosseum and kills him. Crowe unfortunately dies as well from a previous wound, but dies a hero&#8217;s death.</p>
<p>The gladiator battles occur in two different locations. One is in a simple arena within one of the Roman Empire and the other is in the Coloseum in the heart of Rome. The first battle that you see is in the simple arena. Within this battle several gladiators take on slaves, Crowe is one of these slaves, who are chained together. This scene did not really show how a gladiator battle was fought. Most battles were one on one and between two gladiators. Gladiators were in fact slaves or prisoners of war. Once in a while someone would voluntarily become a gladiator but it was not too common. The way this battle was depicted was that all the gladiators were volunteers and the slaves were just thrown in there to meet their deaths. Perhaps the film was just trying to show slaves overcoming the odds and becoming full-scale gladiators in their hopes to gain their freedom. Regardless of the reasoning behind the choice of how they depicted the scene, it was not historically accurate. One good aspect of this fight scene was that they showed several of the types of gladiators. They showed the Myrmillo which had a helmet with a fish like crest on the top, hoplomachus which carried a shield and a sword, and the retairius who fought with a net and a trident (2). The best scene with historical accuracy was Crowe&#8217;s second battle in the Colosseum. It was a one on one battle with a Dimachaeri which was a gladiator who carried two weapons.</p>
<p>At the end of the battle scenes within the Colosseum, the emperor decided whether the gladiators would live or die. In the first scene, Crowe&#8217;s team of gladiators killed all the other gladiators put up against them. They were then surrounded by troops so the emperor could meet them and decide their fates. He puts his thumb up which meant live. During the second scene in the Colosseum, it is a one on one battle between Crowe and another battle. Crowe defeats his opponent but does not kill him and waits for the emperor to decide the mans fate. The emperor puts his thumb down for death but Crowe defy&#8217;s him and doesn&#8217;t kill the man. The idea behind this is true, however they got the directions wrong. Thumbs down meant live and symbolized putting your sword into the ground while thumbs up meant kill. This is a fairly minor mistake and did not really take away from the historical accuracy of the scenes.</p>
<p>Towards the beginning of the film, Commodus instructs several men to execute Crowe&#8217;s character. The executor is going to just decapitate Crowe, but he asks for &#8220;a clean death, a soldier&#8217;s death.&#8221; It was all just a plot to get away which he did, but what he said was very important. Throughout Gladiator, the idea of dying with honor was very prominent. This was a very important aspect of Roman society. Most Roman&#8217;s did not live past thirty and wanted to pass on with honor. They could go to the arena&#8217;s and watch the gladiators fight and either gain a honorable victory or death (1). During the arena and Colloseum battles, you saw the crowds cheering. They movie depicted the crowds as very dirty people. Some of them were eating food and the food would be falling out of their mouths. It seems like the movie was trying to show the crowds as barbaric monsters for cheering at these games of death. Another aspect was that the Roman&#8217;s were a militaristic society. Warfare and death were important elements of their society. In the opening scene, a massive battle occurs between the Roman army and the Germanic Barbarians. Before the battle begins, Crowe says to a fellow commanding officer, &#8220;strength and honor.&#8221; Before Crowe&#8217;s first battle in the Colosseum, a fellow gladiator gave a speech about how to address the emperor and ended the speech by saying, &#8220;Go and die with honor!&#8221; Today, people just live their lives knowing that death is inevitable and most fear it. It is very interesting to know that a culture actually embraced death and wanted to make sure that when they passed on they would be remembered.</p>
<p>Overall, Gladiator is a great movie. It has just the right amount of action and violence to keep people interested and a great story. The idea of a man going from being one of the most powerful men in Rome to being a slave makes a great movie.</p>

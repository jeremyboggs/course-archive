				<p><strong>The white noise and landscaping surrounding War Memorials can subtly affect the mood of those visiting the site.</strong> By observing the people attending a Memorial and paying attention to the feeling one gets it is easy to see how this is true.</p>
<p>            At the World War II Memorial one walks straight into a tourist mess. There are kids running everywhere, people talking in loud voices and the occasional couple seated along the fountain enjoying a romantic afternoon. The Memorial has a lighthearted feel to it, one of comfort more than anything else. Even the fountains are loud; you can hear the water rushing into the air before clapping against more water. The Memorial expresses the feeling of brotherhood that drove many soldiers to fight for the man next to them. The loud and rambunctious pride many WWII movies try to capture almost carries into those attending the Memorial. Most importantly one does not get the feeling of disrespect from the running kids and loud families, it is almost as if that is how the “Brothers-In-Arms” would have had it.</p>
<p>            The District of Columbia War Memorial is in stark contrast to the before mentioned. Walking up to the Memorial it is almost like walking into an ancient ruin, there are trees among trees and just before reaching the site there are hundreds of perfectly kept flowers. There is not much talking to be done here and whispering comes completely natural. While listening to the area you can hear nothing but scurrying squirrels and rustling leaves, it is mostly serene and deep thoughts are certainly not hard to capture. Unlike the WWII and Korean War Memorials, the stone is not flawless slate, it has cracks and chips and it does not reflect; the plant life makes it easy not to notice though.</p>
<p>            The last Memorial I chose to use was the Korean War Memorial. There were a lot of people here, most of them were looking down more often than not and all were near silent. The Memorial puts an immediate weight on one’s chest, a burden almost; it is not a feeling of deep thought like the War Memorial but more a feeling of sadness. The statue soldiers frozen in mid action are standing on unkempt, almost dead grass growing between bits of gravel. I thought it was interesting that the stone was flawless and the water was seemingly drinkable as it reflected the sun, flowing perfectly over edges. Looking into the reflecting stones depicting those lives lost you can faintly see your own face, blending among those who died; it is hard not to get lost in the image appreciating everything those soldiers have done for us. The last picture I took I felt like summed up all the Memorials, “Freedom Is Not Free”.</p>
<p>            The most faint things easily sway our moods, feelings and actions. I think it is amazing how things as simple as flowers or water or even the cracks (or lack of cracks) in stones can affect the image we portray through our actions. I find it fascinating that it is not disrespectful to talk loudly or run through the WWII Memorial but you really wouldn’t dare do the same at the Korean War Memorial, at least not without some pretty mean stares. It is all to easy to get lost in thought at these Memorials, especially when provoked by an assignment like this and that is what I think the intention truly was for the designers. To provoke thought, and to provoke emotion.</p>

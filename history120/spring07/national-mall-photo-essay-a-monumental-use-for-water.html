				<p>     There are many aspects of memorials that contribute to how they commemorate historical figures or important events, and that reflect how our nation wishes to remember and present its history. These aspects, which include the architectural design and the materials they are made of, also have an impact on the way people interact with each other, and the way people interact with the monument. One aspect in particular, the element of water, is incorporated into the design of many memorials such as the National Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, and the National World War II Memorial. <strong>Water is used in various ways in memorials around the National Mall as a tool to help the United States present, remember, and commemorate its history.</strong></p>
<p>     Since I am a Japanese American, I decided to analyze the use of water in the National Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism, which was dedicated in November 2000 in honor of the Japanese Americans who fought and died for American ideals and freedom. The memorial also functions as a reminder of the Japanese families who were forced into internment camps, and acknowledges the failures to maintain liberty, freedom, and democracy in the United States. When at the memorial, a stagnant pool of water acts as the centerpiece and main attraction. The pool is shallow, and contains rocks as well as visible grooves on its floor that make the water look like a well kept Zen Garden. This resemblance of a Japanese Zen/Rock Garden, as well as the rocks that represent the islands of Japan and the generations of Japanese Americans, are symbols of Japanese heritage and culture in America. Another important feature of the pool is its stillness, which can be interpreted as a representation of the suffering and feeling of entrapment of those who were in internment camps. Also, with Zen being a Japanese school of Mahayana Buddhism that emphasizes meditation and intuition, the pool’s Zen garden theme helps promote peacefulness and quite reflection upon Japanese history in America. Being just a block north of the Capital Building, the Japanese American Memorial is in a busy part of town, but it is surprising how quiet it is in the memorial itself. Preoccupied by reading quotes and gazing into the Zen-like pool, visitors seemed not speak to each other, but if they did, it was in a manner too quite to be heard by others. The use of the water in order to achieve this quietness is a mechanism designed by the United States to present and remember the period of Japanese internment as a time of injustice and many mistakes. These feeling of remorse are further encouraged by a quote by President Reagan inscribed on the edge of the Zen pool which states, “Here we admit a wrong. Here we affirm our commitment as a nation to equal justice under the law. “. </p>
<p>     Another memorial in which water plays a significant role in presenting and remembering United States history is the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, which was dedicated to the memory of President Roosevelt and the era he represents. I chose this memorial because of the fact that water played a significant role in Roosevelt’s life. Roosevelt was an avid sailor having been born and raised on the edge of the Hudson River, and was at one point in his early political career the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. Thus, water is a very important symbolic component of his memorial. There are four areas or “rooms” that represent his four respective terms in office, each of which containing a waterfall. As one walks from room to room, each waterfall increases in complexity, which is symbolic to the increasing complexity of Roosevelt’s presidency that was marked by economic depression and world war. There are five water areas, the first of which is a waterfall that has a single large drop-off. This is symbolic of the crash of the economy that led to the great depression. The next is a series of stair-step waterfalls, which was designed to be symbolic of the Tennessee Valley Authority dam building project and the rebuilding of the economy. The third is a group of chaotic waterfalls that fall at varying angles, which is representative of World War II. Here, each waterfall can be looked at as a separate nation with its own unique motives that clash and/or combine with other nations. Ultimately all the waterfalls lead to the same body of water, which is symbolic of many nations in a worldwide war. The fourth body of water is a still reflecting pool that is accompanied by a bronze frieze or “Funeral Cortege” that was designed by Leonard Baskin. Both of which are representative of Roosevelt’s death. Baskin portrayed the effects of FDR’s death by saying, “The great bronze piece is mirrored in a reflecting pool, and just as the bronze depiction memorializes FDR’s death, the mirrored image in the pool symbolizes the profound reflective effect the president’s death had on the American people.”. Because the water is stagnant, this room is a much more quiet area than the others, creating a sense of peace and allowing people to reflect and pay tribute to the life and death of FDR.  Finally, the last water area is a combination of the four previous water areas, a retrospective of Roosevelt’s presidency. Each of these water areas clearly represents a major event in each of Roosevelt’s four terms, creating a historical timeline that can be used to teach or simply remember the time that was so important to United States history. </p>
<p>     The National World War II Memorial opened to the public in April 2004 in honor of all Americans who served in the armed forces and home front during World War II. Located on the eastern end of the reflecting pool, between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument, The World War II memorial is another monument in which water plays a significant role in portraying US history. In the center of the memorial, there is a Rainbow Pool, which is located in between two pavilions. One pavilion is inscribed with the word “Atlantic” and one inscribed with “Pacific”, each having a fountain at their base to represent the two major Theatres of battle. This is symbolic of how the war took place all around the world. Even more symbolism occurs in the center rainbow pool itself, where the circular fountains represent the free individuals of America, and the way that they come from the same pool symbolizes national unity. Furthermore, the architects of the WWII Memorial gave it a mostly light and celebratory feeling in order to reflect how the United States won the war. The Rainbow Pool and its unified fountains contribute to this celebratory atmosphere of the memorial, in that the fountains are similar in nature to fireworks. Also, In contrast to quiet memorials such as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, which is designed for grieving, the noise that the fountains emit gives a sense that visitors are allowed to talk freely. In contrast, there is a still pool of water that sits in front of the “Freedom Wall” containing the 4,048 gold stars that each representing approximately 100 American soldiers who died in the war. This still water is a mechanism to allow visitors to remember the fallen ones in a peaceful manner. Also, the water gives off a reflection of the stars, presenting a sense of greatness to the stars and those who they represent. Thus, the United States used water in the National World War II Memorial in order to remember the power of unified free people with a just cause, celebrate its victory, and to remember that war is never without sacrifice.  </p>
<p>     The element of water is not incorporated into all memorials, but in the ones that do, it is usually not arbitrary and has a specific purpose. This was seen in the National Japanese American Memorial where water was used to cherish Japanese heritage in America and promote peaceful reflection, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial where water was used to portray the events of Roosevelt’s presidency, and the National World War II Memorial where water was used to set different moods of environment. Even though its relevance is often overlooked, the use of water is undoubtedly a significant aspect in how memorials reflect the United States’ desires to remember and present its history. </p>

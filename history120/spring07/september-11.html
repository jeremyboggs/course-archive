				<p>On September 11, 2001, everyone was continuing their every day life when something teriible happened to our country. An airplane hit one of the twin towers without any warning. the look on the people&#8217;s face was shocked and scared. No one knew what exactly was goin gon. Later on maybe an hour has passed; another plane had hit the other twin tower. With these two buildings all of a sudden gettin ghit by airplanes, something was not right. The investigation of the two airplanes striking both the two twin towers needed to find out the truth behind it.</p>
<p>With two airplanes that all of a sudden hit two of the twon towers wasn&#8217;t normal at all. As the day went on, investigation started to began tryin gto fin dout the reason behind this terrible problem. As the days went on, the police investigator started to suspect that it was a terrorist attack. The leader behind this terrible act was from Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda terrorist network. Once Bush found out about this news, he declared &#8221; war on terror&#8221;.</p>
<p>Osama bin Laden has been a prime suspect against the United States. Since 1998, Osama bin Laden has been linked to several attacks including the embassy bombings in De res Salaam, Nairobi, Kenya, and Tanzania. According the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Osama bin Laden is wanted for the top ten fugitives. Although for all o fhis involvements, the September 11 attacks is far worst then all of his involvements combined together. Although Osama bin Laden has not been idicted for the September 11 attacks, he has taken responsibility for those attacks.</p>
<p>As a citizen in the United States, we must be aware for all the issues that is going around. People like Osama bin Laden can be everywhere withought knowing it. Osama bin Laden as anÂ  individual has taken so many innocent lives. The fact that Osama bin Laden has taken responsibility for these terrible accidents will never be forgotten. Osama bin Laden will always be remember as we gon on with out lives and for many future generations to come.</p>

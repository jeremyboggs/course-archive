				<p>Since it&#8217;s debut in 1999, South Park has been a hotbed of controversy over its language and subject matter. As a loyal viewer, I have noticed growth in the shows ability to tackle subject matter with humor and almost irony. For examply, in one epsiode, the boys go through the &#8220;Hall Of Stereotypes&#8221; There, they see a covetous Jew, an Asian with a calculator, and a sleepy mexican, who was actually just the janitor. SOme shows could never get away with something like that, but Ill tell you why South Park can. By being so incredibly discriminatory, the show does not discriminate. The show has managed to insult every mass group, religion, and race in the modern world. And by doing that, South Park has never failed to shock the world. But no group is left untouched, which is why they should be considered fair. South Park will insult republicans and democrats. Blacks and whites. How many times have you laughed at a joke made about your own kind? It&#8217;s because you know that they are simply going to offend somebody else, and you wont get offended. The ones who get too offended are the ones who are too sensitive. Don&#8217;t be too sensitive America.</p>

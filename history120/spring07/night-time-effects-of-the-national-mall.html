				<p>When one thinks of the national mall, thoughts of sunny days and tourist-infested monuments are what usually fills the imagination. What goes largely unseen though to the public at large is the artistic view of the national mall at night. <strong>The effects of the monuments at night are just as powerful, if not more so, than the effects in the light of day. </strong><br />
The first monument I came to was the Vietnam War Memorial. The monument in general has a somber, reflective quality to it. This is due to the numerous names engraved upon the wall of those who died in the Vietnam war, and the physically reflective quality of the marble used. The guise of night greatly enhances these qualities. Walking down the path, the monument would hardly be noticeable save for the string of dim lights along the wall. I feel that this is analogous to the way that the Vietnam war is viewed today. The toll on America from the Vietnam war goes by mostly unnoticed, except as a row of dim lights in the minds of most Americans. Another attribute the monument possesses at night is the absence of the tour groups and children. It really then allows for a chance of quiet introspection on the events that spurred the creation of the monument.<br />
The next monument I visited was the World War II Memorial. To me this monument is very peculiar. Unlike the monuments erected for other wars, this memorial does not make any mention of individual names other than the names of leaders under powerful quotes. This helps to see the event as impersonal and as a grand victory. The memorial at night also accentuates these qualities. At night there is powerful, bright lighting all around the monument, and most stunningly the giant grandiose fountains are lit up. This further conveys the atmosphere of powerful celebration within the monument.  Also, there are four hundred gold stars lit up towards the rear of the monument, which are impressive. Although they represent deaths, they are golden stars which represent patriotism which is in stark contrast to the Vietnam memorial. It is almost as if the statement is being made saying that the soldiers who died in this war died for a good cause. Precisely at midnight at this monument, something amazing happened. The fountains were shut off, and some of the lighting around the edges grew dim, leaving just a giant pool of water in the center of the monument. It may not have been planned to have this effect, but I thought it signified that behind this great victory was also a serious loss, due to the war and to the Holocaust. This memorial at first inspired awe with its fantastic, bright visuals, and then brought out a more mellow mood at midnight.<br />
The last memorial which I sought out was the Korean War Memorial. In the day time, this monument is definitely very creepy, and possibly the most personal out of all of the monuments. The one thing that differs from the monument during the day and night, is that during the day, the small bed of water at the end of the path has a serene tranquility about it, while at night, the stillness and deep blackness of it is very foreboding. At night the whole monument has a very ghostly feel to it. This feeling is immediately brought out by the figures of the soldiers at war. At night, these are very poorly lit, and look almost like specters reliving their war experiences. When one can get a good look at the facial expressions exhibited by these statues, one can see looks of uncertainty, grief, and horror. This is also analogous to the uncertainty in this time of America’s history with the act of entering into the Korean War. To further illustrate the ghostly quality of the monument, the wall which works as the backdrop to the garden of figures is hardly visible, shown upon by a row of dim lights as in the Vietnam War memorial. The faces upon the wall are also barely visible, and the greys in which they are engraved give the characters a further ghostly feeling about them. The monument at night, depicts the Korean War as a horrible and ghastly conflict in the history of the United States.</p>
<p>Although it was through a crazy chain of events that I ended up going to the national mall at night, it was a very awe inspiring time. I wasn’t expecting the refreshingly quiet introspection I was greeted with. I recommend to anybody that truly appreciates these monuments and the history associated with them to go and take a visit at night. The aura of night greatly enhances the architectural and emotional effects of each monument.</p>

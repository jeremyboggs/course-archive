				<p>The three monuments I chose to write about are the Jefferson Monument, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Monument, and the World War II Monument.  <strong>I chose these three monuments because all three monuments use water to express their message about a certain time or person in history.</strong>  The interesting part about these monuments is that although they use water to convey their messages, they all use the water in very different ways.   It is also interesting to note that the Jefferson Memorial was actually created by Roosevelt in 1943.</p>
<p>The Jefferson Memorial is unique in that it does not actually have water in the monument, but it uses water as part of its message.   The memorial is separated from all the other monuments by a large body of water.   When you stand on top of the monument, you can see the whole city and when it is sunny, the water makes the whole scene sparkle.  It suggests that Jefferson is watching over the capitol city and more generally the entire country.  It is like looking at a utopian civilization.  The monument is a tribute to the way he viewed America.  He envisioned a new and beautiful country with unlimited possibilities.  From the top of the monument, you can only see the pretty parts of America; you cannot see the any of the country’s problems.  That is what the artist most likely intended.  In addition, when you look at the monument from the other side of the water, it stands alone and resembles a Grecian temple.  In fact, the monument is constructed using Greek type architecture.  The artist likens Jefferson to a Greek god.  This is a symbolic analogy because Greek Gods were revered by their people as creators and saviors.  Jefferson can be thought of in that way in America.  Jefferson was one of the founding  fathers of our country.  He authored the Declaration of Independence, assisted in the development of the Constitution, and almost doubled the size of our country with the Louisiana Purchase.  He is one of the creators of our country and the artist did a good job in remembering him.</p>
<p>The Franklin Delano Roosevelt Monument, on the other hand, uses water extensively within the monument.  The water symbolizes the different degrees of turbulence and conflict during his four terms in office.   The first waterfall, which signifies his first term in office, is just one huge waterfall.  The waterfall symbolizes the Great Depression.   It was the one huge hurdle that FDR knew that he needed to tackle, and starting his New Deal was the only thing he needed to focus on.  The second waterfall, which signified FDR’s second term, is different than the first waterfall because it has steps.  It is more bumpy than the first one.  This symbolizes how the economic and social problems which FDR had to deal with became more complicated in his second term.  Not only did he have to continue dealing with the Great Depression, but he also had to start dealing with the war abroad.  Although we were not in the war for the majority of his second term, we still could not help but to have some involvement in the conflict.  Things were staring to get more turbulent for him.  The third waterfall, which symbolizes his third term, is different  than the previous two because it is made up of more than one waterfall.  The waterfalls are made up of many broken rocks upon which the water crashes down.  These multiple waterfalls and high pressure water is symbolic of the multiple problems that FDR faced during his third term.  Pearl Harbor had been bombed at the end of his second term, and we had no choice but to enter the war.  The depression was starting to get a little better with the war effort, but there were still many things which needed to be fixed.   Lastly,  the fourth waterfall, which symbolizes FDR’s fourth term, also consists of more than one waterfall, and even more waterfalls than the previous one.  The waterfalls in this set are also have water crashing down on an array of rocks at the bottom.  The reason there are even more rocks in the fourth set is because by FDR’s fourth term, there were even more problems to be solved.  The world was in disarray during this time.  The debate of whether or not to drop the atom bomb was going on, parts of Europe were completely destroyed, Americans had lost many family members to the war, and troops were still fighting.  The economy was doing better, but that was largely a result of the war and the need for increases in production.  People did not know if things would downshift again once the war was over and the additional jobs were not necessary.  FDR had a lot of decisions to make and a lot of problems to grapple with during this time, and the multiple waterfalls, and rocks represent this state of turbulence.</p>
<p>The third monument I picked was the World War II Memorial.  This one also uses water within the monument to help convey its message.  In this monument, there is a huge pool of water in the middle called the rainbow pool.   There is a pillar on each side of the water, one is inscribed Pacific, and the other is inscribed as the Atlantic.  The American states and territories are then arranged in a circle around the water, somewhat in their geographic relation to the corresponding ocean pillar.  In the middle of the pool of water, there two large flowing fountains and various littler ones.  The two main fountains symbolize the Allies and the Axis powers, and the littler ones most likely symbolize the countries who made up these two sides.  The two fountains are far apart to symbolize how far apart the two sides were in their thoughts ideologies.   In addition, water is used in another way in this monument.  In the back of the monument there is a wall with 4,000 stars, and each star symbolizes 100 lives which were lost during the war.  Under the wall is a small reflecting pool.  Looking at the stars on the wall in conjunction with the stars in the reflecting pool gives you a sense of the magnitude of the loss.  Also seeing the stars reflecting in the water gives you the sense that they will live on forever in our nation’s memory.</p>

				<p>In the past five decades society’s perception of women has changed. In the 1950’s, women were homemakers and men we the heads of the home. However, in the average American home does not consists of these two elements. Today, the perception of women is much different than the times our parents.  Over the years women have become equal to men in the home and in the workplace. </p>
<p>The 1950’s were a different world than what it is today. During WWII, lives changed for everyday Americans. Women could not stay at home and be housewives any longer, they had to go out into the workforce while the men were off at war. For years, the women were heads of households, but that all changed once the war ended.  When the 1950’s came around, society tried to put life back in order the way it was before.  The men went off to work each morning and the women were sent back to the homes where they belonged. It was in this time that the Feminist movement began.  At this time in history, and decades before, women were housewives, who came second to men. Women were forced to act, dress, and present themselves in specific ways without any argument. In the cooking clip, it shows how a woman, back in the 50’s, got married and then was tied down to a life of housework and pleasing her husband.  <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=x4qDn0wq4Ng">&#8220;Cooking Terms!&#8221;</a> This clip taught woman how to cook in order to serve her husband.  </p>
<p>As we all know, women are not perceived in this light any longer. Women are no longer expected to stay at home while the men go to work.  Women are even considered equal to men in the workforce, receiving equal jobs and wages.  Women today have come a very long way from where they were just five decades before.  </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPTwyET00X0">Stepford Wives</a> is a movie about a group of perfect families residing in a small town in present-day Connecticut. They were the perfect families because the husbands went to work each morning while the wives stayed home and mended the house.  The women were perfect. They were blondes, they always looked presentable, and they were always second to their husbands.  However, nothing is as it seems, the actual wives were made into robots by their husbands controlled with a remote.  The clip I chose is with Bette Midler’s character as a robot and all of the abilities that make her a perfect wife.  The Stepford Wives, As you can see, not only is her character gorgeous, she is the perfect wife. She cooks, cleans, vacuums, and mows all without ever needing to buy and appliance.  She is even equipped with being able to offer a beer after a night together. She is the perfect wife. </p>
<p>Today, I think that society tries to push more of a balanced lifestyle. No longer do women need to stay at home or either work full time. Today, it is perfectly acceptable and very common to be a working mom.  There is no question that the perception of women has changed in the past 5 decades.  There will always be a select few that feel women are lesser than men, however, as a whole, I think the our society has finally found an equal way of life for us to live. </p>

			<p>I have no idea where you were going with the Stepford Wives reference, and even if you were going anywhere relating to today&#8217;s society, it is only a remake of the 1975 film of the same name, so unless you could compare women roles in those two, I don&#8217;t see the progression you could be describing. As it is, you are only describing the robot wife, which is emphasizing that the perfect wife is one that stays home and does all the house work.</p>

			<p>I agree that the women in the U.S. have come along way in the last half century. However, I would argue that women are still treated a little unfairly. For example, If you look at CEO&#8217;s and top level executives of U.S. corporations you still find the majority of them being men. While I don&#8217;t necessarily agree or disagree with this it is something worth pointing out. True, there are many more women CEO&#8217;s than ever before but I still feel that women are not on a level playing field yet in Corporate America. Unfortunately, I haven&#8217;t seen the Stepford Wives so I was unable to comment on that. This was a very good post, I enjoyed reading it.</p>

			<p>Women have come a long way since the 1950&#8217;s and your &#8220;The Stepford Wives&#8221; clip shows a perfect example of what women were expected to be back then.  As far as the women being equal in the work place, men are still being paid more than women when it comes to having the same jobs.  Also, the higher ranked jobs are filled by more men as well, such as CEO&#8217;s of companies and holding a political office.  This is sad but true since there is still forms of racism and sexism still present in our society.  The clip that you provided from the movie was a good choice since it basically covered everything that a stay at home mom would need in order to become the &#8220;perfect wive.&#8221;  The video from youtube.com was just silly.  Everyone knows how to stir.  The only problem I have is that I cannot find the bolded statement that is supposed to be your thesis statement.</p>

			<p>To begin I think it is a very bold and inaccurate statement to say that women &#8220;have become equal to men&#8221;.  From a legal standpoint that maybe true, however women on average are paid less then men for doing the same job.  I understand that you are trying to get the point across that women are no longer treated or expect to act as they did in the 1950&#8217;s, but I think it is a reach to say that women in reality or the mind set of all American&#8217;s have reached true equality.</p>
<p>This was a good post overall, except for a few gramatical errors and a few overstatements.  I think you were right in your concluison to say that today society pushes for a more balanced lifestyle, but true equality will not be reached until we can stop pushing.</p>

			<p>I agree with your statement.  Over the years, women have been looked upon as more of an equal to men.  Your supporting paragraphs with the examples of the 1950s and the Stephord Wives go great with your thesis.  I like how you elaborated your thesis statement with these examples.  Stephord Wives does show what men may see as a &#8220;perfect woman&#8221;.  However, it does also make the image of women appear frail and powerless to men.    </p>
<p>Your conclusion was broad, so I think you could have elaborated more in your conclusion.  You also stated that women are gaining more power than in the past; however, you do not give examples of how women&#8217;s roles are changing.  You made statements, but they were very general.  Overall, I enjoyed reading your post.</p>

			<p>It was minutely hard to follow your post since there was no stated thesis. I can only assume what your thesis was and try to make the information relate to it.<br />
I agree with what you are trying to say. Womens roles have changed drastically over the last 5 decades. Today women are free to work and be paid well and have countless opportunities and men can also share in the work of keeping their home tidy and with the children. As compared to pre WWII where women stayed at home, took care of the home, children and the husband after he gets home from a grueling day at work.<br />
I must argue with your statement that woman are equal to men on all accounts these days since in many business based companies and in government, they are not.<br />
Your clip from Stepford Wives was a great portrayal of a &#8220;perfect wife&#8221; back then or what men want. It is not a portrayal of a present day actual wife. The women in Stepford Wives movie looked just like the woman in the youtube clip too. However, you did not show any examples of how women are different today in order to compare.<br />
Yes, today is a little more balanaced however, women are still &#8220;expected&#8221; to look amazing at all times. Those that do are more desired than a frumpy woman.<br />
I feel that your closing was a little rushed and just ended. You could have elaborated on how society is balanced and at an equal way of life. Overall, your post was interesting and used great examples.</p>

			<p>I agree with you that roles of women have changed dramatically since the fifties, but your thesis statement is weak. It needs to include an explanation of why women have become more equal to men. Although I think you did a decent job showing explaining what the woman’s role in the household was in the fifties, I don’t see any evidence provided that shows how their roles have changed. In order to do this, you have to explain what they are now so that you can compare and contrast. You can’t just simply say, “As we all know”. If we all know, there is no point in writing the paper. This is why the assignment asked that one of the You Tube clips depict women today. You interpreted your Stepford Wives clip as a modern clip that depicts women in the fifties. But in reality, I think it suggests that the perfect wife today is still one that serves cooks and cleans, which works against your argument.</p>

			<p>To say that women and men are equal in the workforce is almost like asking for rebuttles. I&#8217;ll end there. </p>
<p>I am assuming your thesis was &#8220;Over the years women have become equal to men in the home and in the workplace.&#8221; as i do not see anything else it could be, but i do not see how you prove this at all. The Stepford Wives was a movie, using movies as sources is a gutsy thing to do. It doesn&#8217;t support your argument at all from what I can see, it actually goes against your argument if anything.</p>
<p>If you are trying to prove how women are now equal in the home and workplace why wouldnt you use clips or sources that show this somewhere in your post?</p>
<p>&#8220;The Stepford Wives, As you can see, not only is her character gorgeous, she is the perfect wife. She cooks, cleans, vacuums, and mows all without ever needing to buy and appliance. She is even equipped with being able to offer a beer after a night together. She is the perfect wife.&#8221;   It seems careless, I get the impression you did not proof read your post at all. And I mean, I get that some of the things you said in your post were meant to be sarcastic, or I hope they were meant to be but you never talked about how things have changed. I don&#8217;t know, I am having trouble getting off that.</p>
<p>Your conclusion is heading in the right direction, although it could use a revamp &#8220;There will always be a select few that feel women are lesser than men, however, as a whole, I think the our society has finally found an equal way of life for us to live.&#8221; something about the way you worded that really bothers me. Your thesis/intro paragraph was good but even in that your second sentence really throws me off. I think a proofread or two would have done you wonders.</p>

			<p>Even though you had a few errors in your blog, it was good. Times have changed drastically from before and now men and women are I can&#8217;t say equal (because that&#8217;s not what everyone thinks) but almost getting there. The roles have switched and you may even sometimes find a &#8220;stay at home&#8221; dad now while the mom is out making a living instead of the other way around which is sometimes portrayed in tv shows. Also the stepford wives example was good, I could see what you are talking about because it shows all the examples of the traits women were expected to have a few decades ago.</p>

			<p>I can agree with you. Society has changed to where women are not seen only as housewives. I truely believe that women are still, in a some way, seen as a hosuewives: as we tend to load those chores and responsiblities mostly on women. I think that that is one element that will never change. In addition to that, I still think that women have become a little more balanced with men.</p>
<p>Your post was good. I think that your use of &#8220;The Stepford Wives&#8221; may not have been appropriate. As in a way, it still shows how men view women as the housewife. Other than that, it is a well written post and you did a good job explaining it!</p>

			<p>I agree that in the 1950&#8217;s women were treated much differently than they are today.  Women were definitely expected to act in a much different manner than they are today. Society molded women to dress a certain way and act in a certain way.  I don&#8217;t really agree that women were forced to dress the way they did in the 1950&#8217;s, society just influenced them greatly.  Your blog was quite good over all.</p>

			<p>Your post was interesting to me and easy to follow. I agree with you that women have become equal to men in the home and in the workplace nowadays. But, you did not give any evidence about that. The two video clips only show women&#8217;s role in the past. They do not reflect women in today&#8217;s soceity. Becasue you said women&#8217;s roles have completely changed and become equal to man, it would be good if you give a video clip about women in the present. I also think that it would be even better if you give more comment about the“Cooking term”video clip like you did on“Stepford wives.”Also, you did not bold your thesis statement.<br />
I really like that you give background information about women&#8217;s role in the 1950s in the second paragraph. It really helped me to understand why the 50s video clip portrayed women like that, and it was very useful information.</p>

			<p>There was one thing that you forgot to do and it was to bold your thesis statement.  The first video clip that you gave us was good but to make your post longer you could explain it more in depth like what happened in the clip that you liked and what you didn&#8217;t like.  This way the reader has the same views as you do.  You did a great job by explaining the background information but did lack pulling specific references to the clip.</p>

			<p>What I like about this post is that the post author clearly states that women in today’s society are so much different from the women back in the 1950’s. There are a lot more woman who own their company and can make a living on their own without the help of their husband. What I didn’t like about this post is that the thesis wasn’t bolded so I had no idea what the post author was trying to prove. If the thesis is the last sentence in the first paragraph, then the post author did somewhat prove her thesis by the points that they have brought out adequately. Reading this post, the author did critique.</p>

			<p>I think you did a good job of analyzing the circumstances that led to feminism.  The wartime responsibilities given to women, then taken away, left a void.  The second paragraph is lain out well and its argument is well presented.</p>
<p>I must agree with Colin, your use of the Stepford Wives clip doesn&#8217;t exactly &#8220;[relate] to the depictions of women today that in some way compares to the clip from the 1950s and 1960s&#8221; as the assignment calls for.</p>

			<p>I agree with you in the sense that women today are a lot more outgoing and accredited for there work then they were back in the 1950&#8217;s. They are respected more and contribute more to society, rather then taking care of their husbands and homes. Although you had string points, I would like to point out that even though the women in the movie seemed to be perfect, they were in fact imperfect. They lacked real emotion, which makes women human. They lacked the kind of love and affection they are known to carry (this kind of feature in women is not negative nor is it demeaning, it’s merely one of the few characteristics that can distinguish them from men)</p>

			<p>I do agree with your view on how women in the 50&#8217;s were percieved, and how the role of a women has evolved in this day and age. Before women automatically assumed that role because of what they were taught and what they accepted. These days things are alot different. Women are viewed as equals along side their male counterparts, due mostly in part to the fact that it is not longer a stereotype for women to stay at home and keep the house. You may want to zero in more on your thesis, and also bold the statement. While your post does provide a good analysis, it came off more as a broad comparison versus concise reasons. Lastly try to avoid negative connotation speech&#8230; or at least it came off to me in that manner in this line&#8230; &#8220;Women are no longer expected to stay at home while the men go to work. Women are even considered equal to men in the workforce, receiving equal jobs and wages.&#8221; Good post overall though!</p>

			<p>I understand where your point is coming from, however i disagree that the roles from the 50&#8217;s to now has completely changed. The roles men and women have are always changing, and will continue to change. However, the roles definied by society today still places emphasis on men working and women raising children and being at home. Of course not all of soceity goes by this, but i still think it is prevalent in our society. I think you could have used more examples of your point for modern society.</p>

			<p>I totally agree with you that women have come a long way since the 1950&#8217;s.  There are so many things that they could do not that they didn&#8217;t couldn&#8217;t have done before and I agree with that.  Today women can work and and get paid.  The best thing about your post I think was how easy it was to read.  I liked how you broke it down into multiple paragraphs and explained your examples.  Like I said, I agree with you that women have come a long way since the 1950&#8217;s.  However, I disagree with that statement that women have become equal to men at home and in the workplace.  I still believe that women don&#8217;t have all the right&#8217;s they should have.  Women get paid less for doing the same exact job.  Women are usually the ones being secretaries and working for the doctor&#8217;s.  These are just a few examples.  Also at home they usually are the ones taking care of the children and still putting the food on the table and cooking for their families.  I still think that women are not considered equal to men because of those few reasons.</p>
<p>I have a couple critiques.  First of all, you didn&#8217;t bold your thesis.  It was really hard to tell what your thesis was and that weakened your blog post because I didn&#8217;t what you were trying to prove.  Also, your conclusion didn&#8217;t really summarize most of the hard information that you stated in your post.  Good Job though!</p>

			<p>Your post was well written and you explained it wery well. It is a fact that women have come up over the years. They are now full time workers and compete with men. Women hold some of the most powerful jobs in the world. In many countries women have held the title of president or priminister. From housewifes to  presidents women have defineitly come up in the world.</p>

			<p>I agree with you that women have in fact come a long way.  They are looked at much more highly than they were fifty years ago.  Unfortunately to say that they are equal to men in our society is still incorrect.  As many people before me have stated, most women are not paid as much men are for the same jobs.  Not only that but look at presidency.  Hillary Clinton is campaigning for presidency now for the 2008 elections.  I have heard many people talk about this and most people dont seem to think that she can pull it off.  It doesnt seem that people are ready to put a woman in charge of our country.  I dont understand why, but it just seems that a majority feel this way.</p>

			<p>I also agree that woman have come so far from what there roles were in the fifties. I liked how you brought up the Stepford Wives movie, I thought that the movie really showed how some people still want woman to act. But I do think that because of all the Feminist movements that woman are looked down upon when they do want to stay at home with there kids. I would love to stay at home and take care of my kids but I will know that people will always think that I am forced to stay at home, they wouldn’t know that it was my choice. So I think that was one negative thing about the Feminist movement.</p>

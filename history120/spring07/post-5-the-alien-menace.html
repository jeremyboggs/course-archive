			<div class="entry">
				<p>By definition, a stereotype is a simplified and standardized conception or image invested with special meaning and held in common by members of a group [1]. They can be harmful or beneficial, correct or incorrect, and have been used for many different reasons. Furthermore, stereotypes are always in flux as they are modified to conform to changes in society over time. <strong>Yet, from nineteenth century to present day America, stereotypes have always performed a certain type of “cultural work”, in that they have always been used to define and protect the individuality and uniqueness of any given culture. </strong></p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, the United States experienced a major surge of immigration from foreign cultures that were markedly different than the existing American culture. These immigrants, who were abundant in Irish-Catholics and Chinese, posed a threat by compromising what natives had previously developed as the “American” culture. As a response, immigrants were often mocked and stereotyped in cartoons of newspapers in order to distinguish American traits from alien traits. An example of this can be seen in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44181017@N00/436035716/">this</a> 1880 cartoon from the magazine, <em>Harper’s Weekly</em>, where a Chinese man is depicted coming to America in a tea pot while saying “How e do Melican man. Me comme plenty time. Bling big heap Chineeman”. By using the teapot as a symbol for Chinese culture, this cartoon implies that the Chinese are making America their own home, and not conforming to traditional American values. By pointing out and making fun of the Chinese man’s poor grammar, and exaggerating unfamiliar stereotypical physical features such as clothing, facial structure, and hairstyle, the author helps define what is not American. Thus, in return, stereotypes such as these protect what is American by not allowing alien cultures to blend in. </p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the Chinese were not the only threat to American culture. In fact, prior to the mass immigration of Chinese, Irish-Catholics were the major threat to the existing American culture, which was mainly Protestant. Protestant Americans were afraid the growing number of Catholics would become too influential, and possibly seize control of the government. In magazine cartoons such as <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44181017@N00/436035716/">this</a>, which was also found in <em>Harper’s Weekly</em>, the stereotype that the Irish were ape-like barbarians that were prone to drunkenness and lawlessness was reinforced time and time again. Depicting them in this animalistic manner made all Irish seem untrustworthy, and fueled anti-Catholic notions. This widespread negative preconceived notion about the Irish kept them in check, and helped minimize their influence among American society. Also, by making fun of the drunken, disorderly behavior of the Irish, Americans at the same time were defining themselves as level headed, in control people. </p>
<p>In present day times, America has become a melting pot society. It has become more and more homogenous, and people of different cultures are beginning to lose their discrete identities. As a result, overtly racist stereotypes in newspapers and media (such as the examples above) marginalized significantly in the twentieth century. Yet, stereotypes still do exist today, and are still used to protect traditional cultural values. For example, television commercials often portray the stereotype that drug users are losers, which is a mechanism for promoting a sober, healthy lifestyle to future generations. Similarly, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44181017@N00/436125179/">this</a> image depicts how Uncle Sam teaches us drugs are bad.  Cultural values must be taught to future generations for them to be preserved. Also, because of the melting pot of cultures in today’s America, and the gradual loss of discrete identities among cultures, people sometimes manifest stereotypes given to the group of people they feel most a part of. For instance, if a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44181017@N00/436172883/">Caucasian boy</a> was raised in an African-American community, he or she might wear baggy clothes in hopes to fit in. </p>
<p>As one can see, times have radically changed since nineteenth century America, but stereotypes have always been used to define and protect the individuality and uniqueness of a group’s culture. Throughout history stereotypes have proven to be the cause of many problems and misconceptions, but fortunately, overtly racist ones are becoming less common. But in the end, as long as there are cultural differences, there will also be stereotypes to draw between them.</p>

			<p>I never thought of stereotypes as &#8220;protecting culture,&#8221; I think they don&#8217;t really protect it as much as dismiss it. The one that propetuates the stereotype sees something, say how someone dresses, and says &#8220;oh, he must be a chinaman, put him to work on the railroad&#8221; or in todays society, &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s some poor white boy trying to be black, he must be trouble.&#8221; And they leave it at that, nevermind why they dress this way, they classify them and act accordingly.</p>

			<p>I agree that America has become a melting pot for different cultures and that stereotypes have changes a lot over the years.  Some of these new overly racist stereotypes are harmful to different cultures getting along with one another.<br />
 I do not agree that stereotypes protect American cultures by not allowing other cultures to blend in.  I think that this can hurt our culture by making us seem intolerant.</p>

			<p>I am a little confused know that i have finished reading your Post. I believe that america is now a Nation of many Nations, but i agree with Colin when he says that Stereotypes are not used to &#8220;protect culture.&#8221; I think that you &#8220;Beat around the bush&#8221; it didnt take on this issue head on. When the common person thinks of a stereotype it is not used in a positive mannor rather used to negativly depict a race that is different than another. I think you were scared to talked about this issue and to offend people, but in writing telling hte facts is ok. i liked that you took this other stace though even though i dont agree with it. it made me think of another side to this issue.</p>

			<p>Whether if it is a Chinese man speaking improper English, an Irish man most likely to get drunk, or an African American man dressing in baggy clothes, what is most irritating is that these are all negative stereotypes.  I wish that our society today can change all our negative thoughts on different races because it is creating a separation among them all.  However, I catch myself sometimes judging someone I haven&#8217;t met, but only saw at first glance.  I can admit to believing in some of the stereotypes without acknowledging what I&#8217;m doing is wrong. </p>
<p>I think you offered a lot on your post about this topic.  However, it could have been improved if you included some ways for us to prevent stereotypes and racial judgments.  It would have been better if you included what can stop this &#8220;othering&#8221; and separation we tend to face in America, even though it is becoming &#8220;less common&#8221;.  This is just an advice because this is a very controversial subject to discuss.  I enjoyed reading your post.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m agreeing with some of the posts above about protecting culture. I never thought about that and it doesn&#8217;t make sense to me.I guess by stereotyping in a negative way you are protecting your culture from outside stuff that you don&#8217;t like ,but I think you could of explained more. Maybe if you went into more detail about why you think this then that would have been better and made more sense to me. I see where you are going I just don&#8217;t know if I agree. </p>
<p>I thought you had good ideas in your post and used good ads to get across the message that you were trying to argue, so even though I don&#8217;t totally understand your ideas, I still think you did a good job of providing information and commenting on the ads you found. So it was well written.</p>

			<p>Stereotyping is and will always be wrong. It is not right to make fun of or stereotype someone based on where they are from. But I also believe that if a foreign person wants to become a US citizen, they also need to try and exhibit American culture too. I am not saying that they need to leave everything about their country behind; I just think they should make an effort to learn the language and some of our traditions. At the same time we should make an effort learn other’s traditions too because you never know what amazing things you can pick up.<br />
	I really liked your Irish-Catholic viewpoint. I had never thought about the religious perspective. Being an Irish- Catholic who grew up with many religions are me, I never thought about how the Protestants felt having a new religion moving in on their territory.</p>

			<p>I actually agree with you that people form stereotypes to protect culture, or more specifically their culture. No matter who you are, people who are concretely different than you, especially on issues like religion, can cause a certain fear or anxiety. I don&#8217;t think all stereotypes are formed to cause harm, although usually that is what they tend to do. Most people make judgements to determine who is most like them and who they think they can get along with.</p>
<p>I do agree that you could present some ways that we could use stereotypes and make them either postive or just eliminate them completely. It is important as a society that we learn how to judge someone based on character and not what we initally think of them.</p>

			<p>You have some good points in your post but I don&#8217;t agree with your thesis entirely. I don&#8217;t think that stereotypes are made to protect and define someones individuality, but people stereotype because they are INDIVIDUALS and are already defined and they disagree with most of the things that aren&#8217;t similiar to the way they are. I also personally think stereotypes against Drug addicts aren&#8217;t viewed as badly as being stereotyped against for who you are and where you are from, because an African-American, an Asian, a Caucasian, a Middle Eastern and a European can all team up and agree that its something bad. You are right though, stereotyping has changed drastically in the last century but because of the way people are and the way they think, I don&#8217;t think it will every completely be gone.</p>

			<p>You had many good point, including the religious views and how effective that was on stereotypes and judging others, especially at a sensitive time during the 19th century. Another point i thought was interesting was when you stated that stereotypes are used to protect a culture from change, well I started thinking and I agree, because degrading a person just because of his appearance or religious views is wrong and will always maintain a bad thing, because you&#8217;re not judging a person because  of his personality of characteristic, but because of something concrete is wrong. Stereotypes are for those who are scared of something about a specific person. I enjoyed reading your post.</p>

			<p>There were many strong points in this post, I liked that you made clear that stereotypes can be both good and bad. Also I liked that you made the point that stereotypes change with time. Your thesis was a very strong one, an overall very strong introduction. There was not a single point I could find myself disagreeing with. Many of the generalizations you gave examples of, I had heard of, like the picture of the Chinese comming to America. I did think you could have made the point that most of these stereotypes were formulated by perceived threat from the Americans. Lastly, I liked how your blog seemed to move with time, if that makes sense. First you talked about these extreme stereotypes as the &#8216;alien&#8217; cultures came to America, to telling of how today, America is a big melting pot. I felt that your post was overall a factual post and gave a great representation of stereotypes over time.</p>

			<p>I really like how you take the more general definition of &#8220;stereotype&#8221; and show that they can be &#8220;harmful or beneficial, correct or incorrect.&#8221;  To mention a couple of stereotypes I&#8217;ve grown up hearing: Asians are always smart and Blacks have an innate sense of rhythm.  It&#8217;s interesting that this type of stereotyping is not insulting, at least at face value.</p>
<p>I find your conclusions in the last two sentences of the second paragraph to be intriguing. From what I&#8217;ve seen, European nations stereotype each other, and even find national identity in some stereotypes of themselves. They seem proud of their differences. Never before (at least to my knowledge) has a nation so racially diverse as the US existed, and it seems like racism is a struggle to find some kind of identity (that is not to say that it is necessarily a good thing).</p>
<p>I can find nothing negative to say about your post. Great writing!</p>

			<p>Your post started of very strong. I liked how you defined what a stereotype was. Stereotyping has and always will be part of this culture.  There is no changing that. In the nineteeth century Americans were threatened by the influence of immagrants, the same way most of us feel about immigrants today.  Whether stereotyping is good or bad, it remains a part of this society nonetheless.  Good job.</p>

			<p>First of all, I really liked how you started your post with a definition of theword stereotype.  It got me really interested in what you were gunna state in your post because it started out in an almost professional manner.  I also liked how you said that stereotypes are used to protect one&#8217;s individuality and his/her culture.  I never really thought about or asked myself why stereotypes keep occurring and occurring in our society today, but after thinking about it for awhile, I kind of agree with you.  People use stereotypes to protect their race religion, and even their own views.  I&#8217;m not saying that using stereotypes is right because its defiantly not, but now I can relate somewhat of why we keep having these ongoing stereotypes in the world today.<br />
I don&#8217;t have to many negative comments because you did a really good job.  The only thing I can say is maybe next time to go into more detail to fully prove what it is you are trying to say. For instance, when you were talking about what causes stereotypes.  You coudlv&#8217;ve explained that comment a little more so the reader and agree with your statement or disagree.  It&#8217;s really hard to take a side because the detail is lacking.  Good job though.</p>

			<p>Stereotype is not base where you from and stereotype could be wrong. Though history there had some negative stereotype that can tell people where are you from. After reading your blog, I agree with you the reason people make negative stereotype picture, because they want to protect their culture from something that they don’t like it. Just like you said Chinese man speaking improper English, an Irish man most likely to get drunk, or an African American man dressing in baggy clothes. I think you have lots of information in your blog, however, there were something that was not relating your thesis, it make think that was other issues other than that this is very good blog, and I really enjoyed read it.</p>

			<p>I don’t think America is a melting pot now but more of a salad. I would say it’s more of a salad because in a salad everything keeps its taste and individuality, similarly in America we have so many different cultures and backgrounds, and all these people represent and display their own cultures but at the same time are a part of America. I don’t understand your argument about how stereotypes protect American cultures; this doesn’t seem to make sense, I think this would do more negative impact for us instead of the positive. You did a good job of providing sufficient information for your post.</p>

			<p>I really enjoyed reading your blog. You supported your thesis with good support. The Irish and Chinese influence was taken as a threat and therefore generaizations were made. It is important to realize people will discredit what they don&#8217;t understand. I enjoyed reading your blog entry it was well written and supported. Uniqueness is what makes us diffent and that is a good think. I really enjoyed reading well done.</p>

			<p>I think it was a great job by describing stereotypes as a defense tactic to prevent the assimilation of foreign cultures into American society. What I dont agree with is you calling America a melting pot society. In fact, we discussed that in an earlier class and determined that it is not so much a melting pot, because in a melting pot, everything blends. In America, most cultures are encouraged to preserve their own specific customs and traits, while still being American. Other than that, great post, very good information.</p>

				<p>After looking at different advertisement for runaway slaves I learned something different about slaves.  <strong>In each article the slaves were called English servant man or woman rather than slaves or Negro’s and the owners knew them really well physically and their personality.  </strong>Another point the advertisements make is that the slaves use different methods to hide themselves so they can’t be found for example in the article on October 24<sup>th</sup> 1745 <a href="http://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/gos/search/relatedAd.php?adFile=sg45.xml&amp;adId=v1745101395">James Gibson</a> who ran away lied to everyone who he came across and as noted by the owner as a cunning fellow.  Another example of this was printed on November 11<sup>th</sup> 1747 where <a href="http://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/gos/search/relatedAd.php?adFile=md1747.xml&amp;adId=m1747110004">Margaret Barnes</a> who ran away and claims to everyone that she could predict fortunes for others.  The articles that I read did not state what skills the servants possessed and the reason behind that is that the owners did not what to alert others with the skills their servant’s possessed. This might be a problem in the process of getting them back since the servants will do what they do best in to earn a living while away from their masters.<br />
In the last article that I read was the one where <a href="http://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/gos/search/relatedAd.php?adFile=sg45.xml&amp;adId=v1745041377">John Owl</a> ran away from his master and the interesting part on the advertisement was that he ran away last on February 14<sup>th</sup>.  This tells a lot about Mr. Owl who ran away more than once but was found and returned in the previous incidents.  All the articles were very through with the different clothing that they wore right before fleeing off and also different kinds of scars or any other physical appearance that would identify them.  The advertisements did a lot of great thing describing the servants.<br />
Slaves are all kept against their will as said in the wikipedia article of slavery “Slaves are people who are held against their will since either their capture, their purchase, or their birth, and are deprived of their individual freedom for the purpose of exploitation of their labour and in some cases their sexual abuse.” [1]  This tells us that they never had it easy with their masters so in return they ran away and never returned and if found they would try to find another way to escape  such as Mr. Owl who ran away a couple of times.<br />
All these advertisments shows us how much the owners miss their servants because of the output they gave to the owners such as farming, shoe maker and many more other things.  Inaddition the advertisments also pointed out that they were not called slaves but instead called servant man or woman and the amount of information that they owners knew about them.</p>

			<p>I also noticed in most of the advertisements I read that it seemed as though the masters knew their slaves very well. The way I look at it, they had to. I think that as they found more problems with run away slaves, they began to derive new methods that would be easier in their capture and return. In turn, they began to research about their slaves and know the attributes and characteristics that the slaves possessed, in case anything like that would happen. Honestly, I may be dead wrong and the owners may have just known their slaves very well on maybe a personal level. Though when you think about it, why would a master really spend all that time getting to know there slaves when there were so many slaves working for them? </p>
<p>I thought that you paper was interesting. I really enjoyed the fact that you incorporated specific examples of runaway slaves. Your examples helped me better understand the point you were trying to make, as well as making your paper more interesting to read! So, that was definitely cool. I also liked the fact that you included a quote from wikipedia and then explained it. That made things a little more clear for me. If I had to say one negative comment, I would say it is the fact that you don’t have any links to the advertisements you were talking about. I looked at so many ads, that it is hard for me to remember if I came across the ads you were talking about, so it would have been nice if I could see them.</p>

			<p>I believe that the masters knew there slaves well because as with any employee, you must know them in order to manage them properly. Although some slave owners may have cared about there slaves, I have the impression that most viewed them as property. It would be nice to think that the owners cared for there slaves and treated them as family or at the very least well liked employees, but there just has not been evidence to support this.<br />
Although I agree with the fact that the slave owners knew a great deal about their slaves, I feel as if you contradict yourself in your second paragraph. You are focusing on the slave owners caring about there slaves, and then you go on to say that the slaves are held against there will and want to run away. If the slave owners took good care of there slaves and knew intimate details about them then why would they want to run away so bad? I may have the wrong idea but in the last paragraph you use the word &#8220;miss&#8221; and it throws me off a little.</p>

			<p>It is true most of the advertisements that where placed in markets and papers, where very thorough. Of course the owner new there slaves well, they worked with them everyday (Not physically in the fields).  After a while you will get to know someone very well if you are around them long enough. Some things that are on the advertisements almost sold the slaves to the people who found them. If a slave was captured that had better qualifications that an owner needed but could not buy, that slave was now his. There is now way in hell an owner would let a slave go that valuable.</p>

			<p>Despite having strong details and support, your weak thesis doesn&#8217;t hold up over the facts. In the very ads you posted, it is said Margaret Barnes had a pale complexion, (Never heard of a pale black slave.) John Owl was fat and had a red beard (an Irish African?), and the skin color of James Gibson is specifically absent. Perhaps saying servant instead of slave meant that the runaway was white.</p>

			<p>I thought that this post had some good ideas. I like the quote from wikipedia because it really describes what we as readers are trying to understand. I might of used it earlier in the post to try and set the tone and show the way that you were trying to present your post. I agree that the way that the owners went to so much trouble to have advertisements made, that the slaves they owned meant a lot to them. It showed that they were very important to the people that owned them because all of the work and probably the way that they made money revolved around the work of slaves.<br />
   I&#8217;m agreeing with the comment above about the thesis because it did not make a strong case with the advertisements you presented. I think the lack of looking closely at the descriptions in the advertisements does not support the thesis they way it should. There was a reason they were called servants and not slaves. Two of them from what was described had light complexion. So there was a reason that they were not called slaves.</p>

			<p>I enjoyed your blog post because you used real life situations of slaves who actually ran away and and I can truly say I know their situation now.   As for your whole paper, it is pretty easy to say that the owners new their slaves very well because of all the time they spent day in and day out.  I just don&#8217;t know if you really backed that comment up.  Your first couple of statements desribed how the owners new their slaves very well and they treated them with such great intentions.  After reading those statements I was like ok this is strengthening your thesis, but then in the later paragraphs you used wikopedia to desribe how the slaves were &#8220;always held against their own will and deprived of their freedom.&#8221;  So basically you were saying that the slaves had it bad in those statements?  Im just confused because I thought you were trying to prove how the slaves were treated well at most points.  It just seems that you were arguing two different point of views.</p>

			<p>I really liked how you put in the links to the articles and used a quote from wikipedia. This made your blog much more crediable. I also liked that you used specific situations and slaves which made the blog much more relateable. I also think you support your thesis. I don&#8217;t really see in your blog anywhere where you try to say slaves were treated well, so I think the blog is well organized.</p>
<p>However, I don&#8217;t think you really brought up any new information. Most people know that slaves were well known by their slave masters. Also, I agree that made your examples aren&#8217;t slaves. Perhaps they are in fact servants or indentured servants because they have last names. Usually slaves did not have last names.</p>

			<p>I agree with your idea that owners knew their slaves well. Most of the ads that I read described the details of slaves&#8217; appearance and their characteristics. If the owner did not know about their slaves well, they could not give the physical appearance in the ads. I think that the masters had to know in order to manage the slaves. Maybe, the owner prepared for the situation slaves running away. In order to capture their slaves back, the masters had to know about their salves. I think you got a good point.</p>
<p>You did excellent giving specific example from ads and quoting statement from Wikipedia. However, I do think  those examples support your idea very well. Your thesis is “the slaves were called English servant man or woman rather than slaves or negro’s and the owners knew them really well physically and their personality.” In my opinion, the examples that you provide right after your thesis do not relate to why slaves were called servant. Other than that, I really like your writing. It was interesting to me, and I enjoyed reading it.</p>

			<p>Your blog was very interesting with a couple good points. I learned that the advertisements for the runaways were very descriptive. The information given in the advertisements had to be descriptive because they had no pictures back in this time to easily catch them. As a result, they needed to use physical descriptions and descriptions of their clothing because it would be hard for a runaway to find other clothes to change into.</p>
<p>The post was informative though I found that your main point was not backed with enough evidence. Your main claim that the owners knew their slaves or servants, I feel is not supported well in this case. The information posted in the advertisements could have easily came from the foremen on the plantation looking over those specific runaways, one specific incident that the owner remembers, or the bounty hunters that had caught them on previous occasions. I feel that more evidence should have been given to support your thesis.</p>

			<p>Reading the first paragraph, I was surprised that the owners called their slaves servant man or woman. During this time, racial issues were very big and I was shocked that the owners didn’t call their slaves slaves or Negro’s. I was also surprised that the owners of the slaves knew them very well from personality to appearance. After all, they were slaves and the owners probably didn’t care much about them as long as they did their chores. Also, in order to be free from their owners, I would think that the escaped slaves would do anything to change its appearance from what the advertisement states. </p>
<p>This whole article was very interesting. Towards the end of this article, it states “all these advertisements shows us how much the owners miss their servants because of the output they gave to the owners such as farming, shoemaker and many more other things”. Just reading this sentence does not seem real at all. I think that the only reason why they even have these advertisements is to have their slaves back so they can do more chores. For all the people that did have slaves and actually did care for them was probably only 5 percent out of the whole population that did have slaves.</p>

			<p>I really enjoy reading your blog, because you gave a lot of examples to us. So that way we will understand more about how slave living, thinking and feeling. Why they try to run away from their master. Though your writing and my understanding. It’s so hard for slave ran away from their master. I am sure they will try everything they can for run away. However, the world isn’t making easy for them. The owner will do everything they can to stop, even they can kill one slave to show other slave if they run away from him, they will end up same just like other slave who got kill. Also I believe the owner will make mark on their slaves, so when people see that mark they will catch them easier. I think the reason slave try to run way, because they don’t get treat well. After reading your blog I have better understand about slave why they try to run away. Also you have couple link for us understand your wirting better. I really enjoy, well done.</p>

			<p>I agree and disagree with what you have written at the same time. I agree in that you said the masters really miss their slaves because of how much they used to do for them and how much money they probably made out of them, but I dont think they called them &#8220;servant man or woman&#8221; out of their love for them but more to make themselves look like the good person who tried to take care of the slaves and for people to have sympathy for them if they found them (if in the case the person that found the slave didnt afford to have one). I also think that listing all the characteristics of slave down to keep people on the look out is a bad and good thing at the same time. It is good in that if anyone found them, they would know who&#8217;s slave it is immediatley and return it. But, it is also a bad thing because if the person read the article and happened to find the slave would want to keep him/her out of selfishness because they know everything they can possibly make use out them. In my opinion, the whole slave era was an interesting one in how everything was handled and how it eventually came to an end.</p>

			<p>Ok, I&#8217;m not sure why you started with what slaves were called during slavery by there masters and then discussed how well masters knew their slaves.  I have to agree with what others have already posted. Masters have to know their slaves to some extent in order to better manage them. However, i find it hard to believe that a very wealthy master with hundreds of slaves knew each and every one of his slaves.  After spending enough time with a person you do tend to learn their weaknesses, strenghts, and so on, but not every slave worked with the master.  Very informative post but, what does what they were called by their masters have anything to do with it?</p>

			<p>It was surprising how well these owners paid attention to their slaves.  They most likely knew where all the scars were on their body, and maybe even the smallest blemishes that they had.  I think the reason they paid close attention is because they probably had some past experience with their slaves escaping.  The owners also took into account how common it was for slaves to runaway from their masters.  These owners most likely wanted to keep their guard up so that they could give detailed information about them like in the ads you sourced.  The more the masters could say about their slaves, the easier it would probably be to find them.  I liked how you were specific with the examples to support your statements.</p>
<p>Your blog post could have been improved if you added a bit more in your conclusion.  I thought your ending paragraph was fairly short.  The last paragraph should be longer to conclude your opinions you justified with your evidence earlier.  There were also some grammar errors as well.  However, I enjoyed reading your blog post.  You picked some great sources for your examples.  I liked how you added them into your paragraph and went into depth.</p>

			<p>The way you introduced your thesis really caught my attention. How you said that you learned something new about slaves was a good start. I had no idea that slaves were known as English servant man/woman, that was something new to me. I can understand why the slave masters would want the slaves to come back so badly. Considering how highly skilled some of the slaves were, they were no doubt valuable to the masters. </p>
<p>I was a little confused, the thesis states that slaves were known as english servant man//woman but then later on in the post you said slaves were kept agaisnt their will and you talk about that for a bit, this seems to be unrelated.</p>

			<p>Your post was easy to read and understand through the links of the individual slaves you put in.  It helped me understand a little bit better.  When you kept saying that the slave masters called their slaves servants, I automatically thought of just a butler or something.  I think that the slave owners may have done this on purpose.  Now this might just be a modern idea, but when i here the word slave, i think of the horrible act of forcing someone to work for you without pay.  Perhaps some people back in the day thought as we do now.  Maybe they didnt condemn it as we do today, but maybe by saying the word &#8220;servant&#8221; rather than &#8220;slave&#8221; they could think better of themselves and not guilty.</p>
<p>You do make a bit of a contradiction in your post when you say that the slave masters knew their slaves well and then later on when you gave the definition of slavery.  Sure the slave owners probably did know their slaves well.  Now this is not to say that they knew their life story or anything.  Some slave owners probably just consentrated on their slaves behavior and such to see how good of a worker the slaves were.  Other slave owners may have been &#8220;nicer&#8221; and actually gotten to know their slaves.  I&#8217;m sure there must have been some slave owners, although i bet few, who actually conversed with their slaves.</p>

			<p>I disagree with the majority of your post. You stated, “The articles that I read did not state what skills the servants possessed and the reason behind that is that the owners did not what to alert others with the skills their servant’s possessed.” While this is a good point as to why the slave owners should NOT mention the skills the slaves possess, I find it to be false. The ad that we read in class from Thomas Jefferson lists many skills that the slave had. Jefferson mentions “coarse carpenters work” and that shoemaking is what the slave will most likely try to find work for. Also, in another student’s post was an ad from Goddard stating about a slave, “He is a good cradler, and a very handy ingenious fellow….” I agree with you that they should not be stating this because whoever finds them may want to keep them for themselves. Also, I believe that by stating more of what a person looks like and specific marks on their bodies, someone will be more likely to recognize the slave and turn them in. A person who finds this slave will not know anything of their craft, only their body size and markings. Then they will be less likely to want to keep them because the slave could actually be a horrible worker.</p>
<p>You do however make a very interesting point that the slaves would mask, change, or lie about their identity. That is very smart for the slave so that they will not be recognized from the ad. But, by mentioning marks on the bodies, one can easily recognize a slave, even if they were to lie about their craft. </p>
<p>To be even more critical, you need to watch your words and spelling. There were places where words were left out and I had to re-read the sentence figure it out.</p>

			<p>This post contradicts the previous post in the fact that the skills either being mentioned or not.  This just shows that it was left up to the slave owner whether or not to be very specific about the runaway &#8220;servant&#8221; or just describe them physically.  It is pretty obvious that the slave owner will know how the slave looked and what clothes they wore, he owned them.  I hate to say it, however, the slaves were just pieces of property that the owner had in order for them to be able to live a little easier.  It is known that the more property you own, the more money you have, the more powerful you are.  Whether or not the slave owner actually interacted with the slaves would determine if he knows the slave personally.  In the Thomas Jefferson ad, Jefferson knew that his runaway was left-handed, consumed alcohol, and was diligerant when intoxicated.  This led the class to believe that he was very close, or interacted with him on a daily basis, and was comfortable enough with him to have a drink with him.<br />
I do, however, agree with you on the example advertisements that you gave.  It makes perfect sense that the runaway slaves would do anything in order to stay free.  They lied and disguised themselves in order for them to survive and not have to be returned back to their owners.  The other example that you supplied, Mr. John Owl, showed how badly slaves wanted to become free.  John Owl tried to escape several times and would be captured and returned to his owner, only to turn around and try to escape again.  Owl just assumed that as long as he has not been killed by his owner, he will continue to try to escape since the freed live was much better than that of a slave.</p>

			<p>After reading the advertisments for slaves that had run away, i was also quite surprised by the amount of information the slave owners seemed to know about their slaves. The detail they went into in the ads was extensive, and showed that they seemed to really know a lot about each slave, or at least ones that seemed to hold a lot of value. I agree with you that the slaves had great reasons to run away, clearly because they were being held against their will and there also being a chance, especially if you were a female slave, of being sexually abused. </p>
<p>In particular about your post, I liked how you included the links to the specific adds you talked about, it gave a lot more context to your post. This also made your arguments stronger. The only parti really disagree with is where in the post you stated many owners did not list specific skills their slaves had, but may be true for the specific as you were referencing, but in class we also read ads where there were many specific skills listed, such as the ad created by Thomas Jefferson.</p>

			<p>This blog does an excellent job of describing how these runaway slave ads were constructed and why they were written the way they were.  The examples were good and provided evidence to support the thesis (i.e., that the ads often referred to slaves in less inflamatory terms) and also demonstrated the detail in which a slave’s personality and appearance were described in the ads discussed.  I also thought it was very interesting that you pointed out how the slave masters offering  rewards would not divulge the skills of their slaves because they feared they would not be returned, if found.</p>
<p>Although you provided good evidence within your article to support your thesis, it was not very hard to find slave runaway ads that contradict your implicit claim that slaves were typically referred to as an English servant man or woman, rather than slaves or Negroes.  For example, one ad regarding a slave named Quamana refers to the subject as a Negro, and not as an English servant man.  Also, I feel that your second paragraph does absolutely nothing but state the obvious.  Everyone knows that slaves “never had it easy with their masters.”  Also, as far as the in depth description of slaves by their masters, there seems to be no evidence presented that those descriptions were given by the master offering the reward.  In my opinion, it is likely that, in most cases, the descriptions were probably given by a foreman or overseer of some sort.</p>

			<p>In this blog, the writer does a good job elaborating on the freedoms that slaves were stripped of.  People often tend to forget that slavery was more than just working without pay. It was the total debasement of human beings.  Also it was interesting to hear about the postive and negitive aspects of teaching a slave how to read and write, from a slave owners perspective.  Although, in many runaway slave ads, the skills of the slaves are not divulged, it is clear that certain slaves were valued more than others.  For instance, Cheshire is valued at 40 Shillings, yet the only skill described on the poster was that he was a fiddle player.  In another ad,  Dick is valued at 31 Shillings, but no attributes are described on the poster.  It is very possible that Cheshire is valued at a higher price than Dick because he is at the very least educated in music.<br />
The opening line of the blog is a good one, but I think you should go on to say that after the enactment of the Abolition of Slave Trade Act, slavery continued in America for another 60 years.  In fact, it is very important to note that the institution of slavery managed to hang on for so long after the federal government took this action.  The 60 years of resistence from the system of slavery, even after the Abolition of Slave Trade Act had made clear the moral wrong that slavery was, is a shocking thing.  Your statement is not incorrect, but  I just think it needs to be explained within its greater historical context.</p>

			<p>I thought it was interesting that in the ads you chose, all three slaves had both first and last names. The ads revealed enough information to make the slaves easily recognizable, but at the same time, not enough information to make whoever found them want to keep them for him/herself. Your thesis was a little weak though; I don&#8217;t see enough significance or evidence in calling the slaves &#8220;English servant man or woman&#8221; to make it part of your thesis.</p>

			<p>There are both positive and negative aspects of your post, but I felt the negative aspects vastly outweighed the positive. Beginning with a positive aspect, I think you did a good job reading the mentality servants through John Owl. As you mentioned in your post, you can begin to understand how much misery John Owl went through by the fact that he ran away multiple times. I think this is interesting because if indentured servants were this determined to run away, you must wonder how determined African slaves were to run away. Also, the fact that he has been caught and returned several times gives insight on how easily African slaves were caught. </p>
<p>On the down side, other than your poor grammar, your thesis statement is only partially true. When I was reading through ads, I noticed several times when the owner referred to the runaway as a slave or Negro, which is contrary to your thesis statement. I believe the runaways that you speak of in your post are not slaves, but indentured servants. Just like the three people you mention in your post, indentured servants tend to have both first and last names. Also, you claimed that the articles you read “did not state what skills the servants possessed”, which is untrue, for James Gibson is a House-Carpenter and Sawyer, and Margaret Barnes is a Breeches maker. Overall, I think you could have made much stronger claims in your post.</p>

			<p>Your comments about master/slave interactions were very interesting. Your incorporation of Wikipedia facts along with your detailed account of what the articles stated was greatly appreciated. It gave your paper a sense of fact-based inferences, instead of just your opinion.</p>
<p>I saw several areas in your paper that I might see a difference in. I do not think that slave owners really knew their slaves. Giving a description of them does not mean that they knew them personally or cared about them. Slaved were usually purchased in a market type situation, were slave owners would critique slaves, and pick the most physically fit one. Also, your article seemed to suggest that many slaves had the opportunity to escape, return, and escape again. In a lot of situations if slaves were caught and returned they would be killed or severally injured.</p>

			<p>I enjoyed reading about the articles read to write this essay. I thought it was very nice how you made the assumption that slave owners put out information such as their slave being a &#8216;cunning&#8217; fellow, in hopes that people would recognize these if they saw the slaves. Also I thought it was great the assumption was made that the slave owners were worried that the slaves might be able to find work with their talents.</p>
<p>One thing I believe should have been considered while writing this essay is some of the reasonings for the slave owners to be worried that their slaves with skills were gone. I believe it should have been considered that the slaves owners could end up losing their slaves to other slave owners. If someone found a slave could threaten to turn them in and try to make a deal with them, they will treat them better in exchange for their services. As well as their not being returned of course.</p>

			<p>I really wish you would have elaborated on your thesis. I want to know what difference it made if in the papers they were called slaves or English servants. Maybe this was just the slave owners trying to look more suffisticated by hiding behind the word &#8220;servant&#8221; instead of &#8220;slave&#8221;. I don&#8217;t think this had anything to do with the respect for the slaves, because in the end they were still owned by somebody else.</p>
<p>Also, knowing their basic atrributes does not mean that somebody knows somebody else well. This can also be told to the owner by many other different means, such as other slaves or a paid worker of the plantation. I think your post was trying to show that beneath the apparent oppression, there was a shade of sympathy or respect for slaves, and I&#8217;m not convinced.</p>

			<p>I thought you did a good job with explaining how slaves were found. It seems like it would be very hard to find a slave based off the information given, but some how it sometimes worked, such as with Mr. Owl, who was returned only to runaway again. I like how you added the dates of when the advertisements were posted. It gives you a good feel of how long ago these happened.</p>

			<p>Your post was very interesting. It really surprised me how well these owners had paid attention to their slaves. The reason that they probably knew their slaves so well was because of slave that had runaway in the past. So that by any chance if it had happened again, they knew exactly what to include on the ad from their skills to their scars. So that if a runaway slave did try to disguise themselves they would easily be discovered by the scar that was noted by their master. Another reason, they might have known their slave so well was because they worked for them. When someone works under someone, they usually know everything about them, from their good habits to their bad habits. Your ads were very useful and very interesting.<br />
Overall, I enjoyed your post. At times I would get confused because of your word choice but overall it was good post. Very informative.</p>

				<p>                Growing up in the DC area, most of us don’t appreciate all the resources we have in our backyard.  DC is known for being a historic place where the history of our country was made. Every corner has a memorial and to the younger generation, some may think of it as “boring”. But to tourists from around the world it is a place to remember. <strong>A memorial is designed to preserve a memory of a person or event; it keeps the memories of the past alive for today. </strong>I visited three memorials that I thought were a symbol of our past and significant for the future. I chose the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, The Korean War Memorial and the World War II Memorial.         </p>
<p>                The first memorial I visited was the Vietnams Veterans Memorial. The Vietnam memorial is consists of three parts, the wall, the soldier’s statue and the woman’s memorial.  The most well-known is the wall with all the names of the 58,256 names that have now recently included woman. One thing that I noticed when I was there were little symbols around all the names. I found out that those symbols have meaning to each one. The missing is denoted with a cross; the confirmed dead are marked with a diamond. If the missing return alive, the cross is circumscribed by a circle, and if their death is confirmed, a diamond is superimposed over the cross. The vast amount of names show how many people died in that war and by the style of the memorial, the larger part towards the middle has an impact when you reach it. There was a newer part to the memorial called The Three Soldiers that created some controversy. It consisted of a White American, Black American and a Hispanic. They were deigned to look over at the wall from a distance but not be a part of the wall but and addition.<br />
                The second memorial that was along the way was the Korean War Memorial. The style of this memorial is a open triangle with 19 soldiers including, 15 Army, 2 Marines, 1 Navy Corpsman, and 1 Air Force Forward Air Observer. If you look closely at each of statues facial expression, they are all unique and show the emotion one could have felt being in that war. Looking at the memorial you could see the Asian influence with the juniper bushes at there feet to show the harsh conditions the soldiers were faced with. There was also a wall similar to the Vietnam wall, but very different. It was made of granite, so when you looked at the murals you could also see your reflection. At the very end of the memorial near the tip of the triangle there was a peaceful fountain, The Pool of Remembrance.  It has inscriptions of the numbers killed, wounded, missing in action, and held as prisoners of war. Near that pool engraved in a granite wall, is the message “Freedom Is Not Free”, which has a great impact when you first read it.<br />
                The last memorial that I saw was the newest, The World War II Memorial. It was open in 2004 to the public and dedicated to President George W. Bush. The monument consists of 56 pillars the have the names of the states, districts, and territories that surround the fountain in the middle. There are two arches at the ends of the memorial, Atlantic and Pacific. On the outsides of the memorial you can find carving of scenes from the war, you can also find quotes from presidents all around the walls. There was some controversy about the memorial when it was first built. In the past the area that the memorial was built upon was used for protests and demonstrations. The National Coalition to Save Our Mall opposed the design and the location of the memorial because of the location in-between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial.<br />
                Even though there were controversies with all three memorials I think that if it was not there some in the future may not remember the past. With the impact of the statues and all the names on a wall some can connect with the memorials in a different way then they could with a textbook. We learn from the past to have a better future and what better way to remember the past with memorials.</p>

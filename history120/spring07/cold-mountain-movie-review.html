				<p>          “Cold Mountain” takes place during the Civil War in North Carolina when the men living in this area are rushed to join the Confederate Army. This movie portrays Ada’s, a woman who falls in love with Inman, perspective on the war while waiting for her love’s return. She continues writing letters to him while he is fighting, but he doesn’t respond back to her. <strong>“Cold Mountain” shows a great historical interpretation of the Civil War because it illustrates the struggle and terror the civilians had to overcome to survive by portraying Inman as a man of strength and heroism.</strong></p>
<p>          One of the ways this movie illustrates a historical interpretation is by interpreting the word “masculinity” without agreeing with society’s perspective on men. In other words, unlike most movies where men need to be shown masculine in order to be perceived as powerful or worthy, Inman is shown to be courageous because he struggles to survive. Inman shows heroism twice in this movie when he risks his life trying to save two of his fellow companions fighting in the war. He gets shot once when he tries to save his friend who had already died. In this way, Inman is illustrated as a caretaker who is compassionate for others. He is shown vulnerable because he is alone, homeless and hungry. He begs for shelter, depicting the role of manhood society stresses.</p>
<p>          Because “Cold Mountain” also illustrates a love story, this movie helps viewers to side with Inman’s survival so that he could return to Ada. Inman’s humble personality to care for others makes the audience believe that the confederates are unfortunate people in an unfortunate circumstance seeing they have no choice. Furthermore, the movie shows run-aways as traitors so their families are put to suffering. For example, in a particular scene when one of the men who escaped was found, they killed the man’s family and tormented his mom by tying her hands onto a log and stomping on it. Scenes such as these make the audience feel great sympathy for those dragged into the war. This scene also signifies a historical sense of how people in the same confederate sides could go against each other, so it was hard to trust anyone.</p>
<p>          I feel this movie does not necessarily show which army is the good or bad side. Although it shows Inman’s heroism, he does not account for the rest of the Confederate army. Like the previous example, people in the same army found quarrels amongst themselves finding traitors instead of helping each other. The people in Cold Mountain who are forced into this battle are shown with the most struggles, therefore viewers will sympathize for them. To make us sympathize, there are many brutal clips of these innocent men crying in agonizing pain when wounded. Their rivals in the Union army are not completely shown as horrible people. In a particular scene when Inman is searching for shelter he is welcomed by a mother who provides him with hospitality. When the Union army came into the home looking for food, one of the men in the troop raped the mother, but the other man tried to help the baby from being cold. This scene is shown to prove how not all people fighting for the Union army were horrible people. Thus, there is no right or good side portrayed in this movie. All the people during this time in the Civil War were just struggling to survive, struggling to return back to their families, struggling because of hunger; they were all in the same circumstance. Traitors were most likely caught and dawned with revenge.</p>
<p>          In conclusion, “Cold Mountain” portrays the time of the Civil War in a historical and realistic sense. It shows graphical scenes of men constantly fighting in gruesome wars, and families awaiting their loved ones for a safe return back home. This movie is realistic in that it shows the struggle for Inman and Ada; a struggle for a solider forced into the war and a struggle for a women at home. For instance, she is trying to cope living on her own after her father’s death with Inman gone. It was interesting how the movie did such a great job in portraying how everyone during this era was bound to suffer. The truth didn’t seem “bent” at all, I do not believe this movie is particularly stressing which side was good or bad, nor making any dramatic adjustments to what really happened during this time. “Cold Mountain” does a phenomenal job in illustrating that a man can still be honorable even though he shows vulnerability.</p>

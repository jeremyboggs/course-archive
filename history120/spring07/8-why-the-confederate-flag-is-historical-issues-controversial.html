			<div class="entry">
				<p>The confederate states of American were the government formed by southern states of the united states of American during the civil war. There were eleven southern states used flag which it made by southern states, and the confederate flag used during its existence form 1861 to 1865. The confederate flag is still a widely recognized symbol, to people in the southern United States who were support the confederate flag; it is a symbol of their heritage and pride. To northern states confederate flag see it as a symbol of the institution of slavery and racial segregation. <strong>After civil war, the </strong><strong>confederate flag is still big historical issue whether or not people show displaying flag or just ban flag from united of American forever.<br />
</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>I found two very good articles that oppose each other and that are arguing against each other. In first article, should confederate flags be kicked out of class? There had biggest issue about wear confederate flag T-shirt, or school should display confederate flag in class room. The school don’t want to their student wear T-shirt which it has confederate flag in it, and they also they want their teacher displaying confederate flag in their class room. Some students say that the flag represents slavery and oppression and that it has no place in school pperpetuating racism.  If they see any students who wear confederate flag T-shirt they will be suspended. .” Hudson High&#8217;s principal, Greg Wright, says the ban is necessary to keep the peace. He told students, &#8220;I&#8217;m a Southerner too. But we&#8217;re Americans first. That has to be our priority.&#8221; The school think confederate flag symbol of the institution of slavery and racial segregation. Also confederate flag is big issues between students; sometime student will fight with each other for what the confederate flag stand for.</p>
<p>In second article, The Confederate Flag: Symbol of Valor on Behalf of a Bad Cause by Machubin T. Owens.  Machubin T. Owens supports the confederate flag in different point of views. He thinks confederate flag is symbol of heritage and pride. He said America is free country, and we have to right to show our feeling. The slavery was not the cause of the civil war; Northerners need to avoid the sort of triumphalism that characterizes so many anti-flag editorials. For instance, when slavery was abolished in the North, Northern slave owners were more likely to sell their slaves south than to free them. In addition, many Yankees grew rich in the slave trade. During civil war, the southern people who fight for their states they fight for their pride and some of them didn’t own slavery during the war.</p>
<p>After read those two articles, I have lots of thought about whether we should display flag in the pubic place or not. The confederate flag to some people were very offense I think because those don’t want to forget what happened during civil war, they want to use this issue to remember that war. And also they really don&#8217;t want to see that happened again. However, the confederate flag to other half people, they see heritage and pride. They want to remember those people who fight for their states. Confederate flag to me is symbol of history, and we should remember what happened during civil war, I think it is good thing to know, what confederate flag is. If we can look confederate flag in different point of view, see it as part of USA history not the slavery and racial segregation. Then we can use confederate flag as learning tool, that way we can respect flag, history and other people feeling.</p>

			<p>I can understand how the Confederate flag can be used to learn and remember a part of our history. Though the real quesiton is, at what cost? I think that it is time to start moving past the whole slavery issue than still debating and fighting over it. If we allow the Confederate flag to be displayed, even with the best intentions, we are still creating controversy. As long as that flag is up, someone will be opposed to it and it will still be a major focal point of our society today. We need to move past that and just ban the idea all together as a way to preserve the &#8220;health&#8221; of the nation. </p>
<p>Your post was good. I liked how you showed the two sides and added some of your own thoughts as well. I think that you need to work a little bit on the orginization of your paper. You don&#8217;t really transition your paper very well. Also I think that you need to make some of your parts a bit more clearer. Other than that, good!</p>

			<p>I very much agree with you that people need to see the Confederate flag in a new light.  It has been quite a long time since there were slaves in America.  Now I realize that slavery was a horrible part in American history, but it has been so long I think we all need to just move on.  I really can&#8217;t see the repercussions of allowing people to fly the flag being too high.  Yes you will get some complaints, but people complain about most things as it is.  I really feel that people need to at least try to move on from what they think the flag means and see it for what it really does mean.</p>
<p>I really liked how you mentioned a lot of history in your post.  In the first paragraph you gave a brief discription on the Confederacy which I thought was a good idea.  I also liked how you post all the sources you used after your post was done.  The only problem with your post was at times it was a little hard to understand what you were trying to say.  Aside from that I enjoyed your blog post.</p>

			<p>I think you started out well by saying that the flag is a symbol by so many people as a negative aspect in todays society. That so many people still relate to the flag as a part of slavery, when that isn&#8217;t totally the case. You provided good links and articles to what you were trying to argue and it was good to see what regular people thought about the flag and the meaning that it had to them. I think that no matter what throughout our lives the confederate flag will never be accepted by society. </p>
<p>For me it was hard for me to understand what you were trying to say at times and I had to just guess and make my own assumptions about what you were trying to get at. It seemed scattered at times and I thought your thesis statement was vague and could have been more specific to your argument. Other then that I liked the articles and the post was good.</p>

			<p>I think you did a really good job in giving background information explaining how the confederate flag came to be, but it is not as simple as the northern states thinking it symbolizes oppression and the southerners thinking it as southern pride. In other words, it is not a battle between the north and south. Many people from the south frown upon the flag and many people from the north think its fine. </p>
<p>I also think you provided good evidence and clearly showed the opinions of both sides, but you should have briefly states them in your thesis statement. Overall, besides your grammar mistakes, your post was good. I definitely agree with you that the confederate flag, as well as the controversy it causes, should be used as a learning tool. But, you never really stated your opinion on whether or not the flag should be displayed in public places.</p>

			<p>Your post seemed to have many grammatical errors in it and it was very difficult to understand what points you were trying to make sometimes.  I do agree with you that the confederate flag is an important part of our history and it should not be banned from public places simply because it causes controversy.  Having a difference of opinion over many issues is what makes us Americans and the moment all the controversies are solved and we stop disagreeing with each other our country will never be the same.</p>

			<p>Your introduction was very informative to me. I like that you gave some background information about confederate flag, and it makes me understand better about the issue. I also think that you summarized both editorials well. The articles and their argument were pretty clear to me. However, I did not quite understand your own opinion. Although you did a good job summarizing the argument for both side, you did not really choose either side and did not show your own thought. In my opinion, displaying confederate flag should be banned. Even though southerner are so pride of their heritage, they should not display flag publicly because others can feel oppression. We cannot deny that confederated flag is related to slavery and racial segregation. As long as flying flag can give negative impression to other people, it should be banned. Hurting someone’s feeling cannot be a way to show other’s pride.</p>

			<p>This blog was very poorly written, it seems as though you didn&#8217;t proof read it at all.  I thought it was interesting how your thesis did not involve taking a position.  I don&#8217;t think that not taking a position is a bad thing.  Seeing that the rest of your blog only promotes the debate.</p>

I especially enjoyed the introductory part it really grapped my attention. I liked how you brought both sides of the argument which gave both point of view on this sensitive subject. Also bringing your own personal thought on both point was nice. Overall nicely written.</p>

			<p>I agree with you that some people want to keep the Confederate flag because it reminds them of a history that defines something other than slavery.  However, there will always be a group of people who disagree and find the flag to be offensive.  I feel that no matter if we take it down, the flag may still be controversial because we were not considerate of how African Americans and other groups felt about the flag in the first place.</p>
<p>You make good points and arguments in your paper.  However, you did have a lot of grammatical errors in your post.  Some of your sentences are awkward and do not make sense.  At certain points, I thought you could do a better job at elaborating your thoughts a bit more.  However, you did a great job on your post.  I enjoyed reading your blog!</p>

			<p>This post was pretty difficult to read since there were so many grammatical errors.  However, I did get the point of it.  Yes, the Confederate flag has always been very controversial and it seems that this problem will never go away.  I liked how you showed an example for each side of the argument that way both sides have their say in your blog.  Your opinion counts to and you expressed it in the last paragraph.  I&#8217;m sure that a lot of people feel the same way that you do.  Just make sure you go over your work before you turn anything in, that way when people try to read it, they won&#8217;t have as much trouble as I did.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m sorry if this is a typo, but in your introduction, twice you referred to the country as the &#8220;united states of American&#8221;. It&#8217;s the United States of America.</p>
<p>I liked how you said, &#8220;If we can look confederate flag in different point of view, see it as part of USA history not the slavery and racial segregation.&#8221; While I totally agree that this is how it should be viewed, it&#8217;s hard to look at something that represented slavery, (among many other things), and be unbaised towards it.</p>
<p>I also liked that you gave us links to your articles and pictures. It shows that you did some research on the topic. However, you did have a great deal of grammatical errors and it was very hard to follow sometimes.</p>
<p>I also liked that you gave a good example of people from each side before choosing what you believed was right. Overall it was pretty good but you should definitely do some proof-reading next time.</p>

			<p>Good and well written post! I like how the post author clearly states the argument of both sides. The post author thesis is clearly supported by the facts that they have found in the articles that they have found. What I like about this post is that the author gives examples from both sides on their view of the confederate flag. Here is an example that is against the confederate flag “If they see any students who wear confederate flag T-shirt they will be suspended.” Here is an example that supports the confederate flag “He said America is free country, and we have to right to show our feeling.” What I didn’t like about the post was the small grammatical errors. From what I’ve read, I somewhat agree that the post author has summarized and critique the two editorials accurately. The post author summarized and critiqued the two editorials by giving examples from each side. The examples shown from both sides clearly show us that the post author has carefully read the two editorials. I can’t really agree or disagree the side that the post author has chosen because no matter which side they have chosen; it clearly states what it means to them.</p>

			<p>I really enjoyed reading your post. You took a very unbiased approach and was positive throughout it. I liked how you took articles from both sides of the argument, that shows that you really had an unbiased opinion. Personally, I feel that those who cannot open there eyes to see that the Confederate flag does not stand for racial segregation anymore are very judgmental and have no compassion for those who believe in it. Like New Yorkers have pride in the the Statue of Liberty, we have pride in our flag. Good post!!</p>

			<p>Even though I feel that it is ok to display and be proud of the confederate flag, I do agree that it should not be displayed in a school setting. Children do not know what it means and are not mature enough to inteligently argue it. It could lead to fights and perhaps even acts of racial hate. Kids tend to fight in school and is feelings of racism or pride are threatened or provoked by another kid, fights and actions to defend themselves are likely to happen. School is intended to be a learning environment and neutral territory where all races can feel confortable.<br />
I fully agree with you that all should know what it is and then they can decide for themselves what to think and whether or not it is worth being proud of. I myself own a confederate flag and see it as southern pride. I am not ashamed of where it came from. I feel that it is a personal thing and others should not press it upon society. It is one&#8217;s own personal choice and it would be un-democratic to say it is unlawful to display. We have freedom and rights to say and act how we feel. There are many reason to fly a confederate flag, not just to show racism. Perhaps one is proud of a relative that fought in the civil war.<br />
Your post was very good. It showed both sides and you gave your opinion. You were very unbiased in your approach and it is ok to not chose a side.<br />
The only problem in your post is that there are many typos. Perhaps you should have had someone read over it first. Overall it was inciteful, knowledegeable, and well organized. I learned that the North would sell their slaves and be profitable over it. Its as if since they could not make money by using the slaves, they would sell them to those that could and still make a profit. I found this to be very interesting.</p>

			<p>The confederate flag is a very difficult issue to address. I believe some of the problems come from issues that are not discussed. I thin that there are underlying reasons, beyond heritage and beliefs that are real reasons for wanting to keep the confederate flags. Saying the flag is a symbol of our history, is true but not accurate. The United States had a flag before the confederate flag, so therefore the people who say they are doing it for their heritage should really be carrying around the original stars and stripes. </p>
<p>I think your post was interesting. A few places had some grammatical problems but I think that you did a good job.</p>

			<p>This post was very effective in sheding light on two sides of a debate. I liked that the articles you gave showed two different perspectives on the issue. Presenting a reader with two informed, logical perspectives causes us to truly think more critically on the issue, this was a strong element of your paper. </p>
<p>One part of the post I felt was week is that you did not take a stand on the issue. Overall this made the post a little less interesting to read. This is not necessarily a bad thing, to be an unbiased speaker of the issue, just more interesting if you are.</p>

			<p>Besides some of the grammer mistakes, you had a pretty good post. I still don&#8217;t agree, and probably never will, that the Confederate flag needs to be banned. I am not disgusted when I see it, nor do I agree with racism. When I see the flag I think of how our country was almort split a part by the war.</p>

			<p>Overall you did a good job with this post. I don&#8217;t agree with you saying that the flag should be banned simply because there are so many people who see the flag as a symbol of their heritage and pride, that by banning it, you are only going to offend them and you will never be able to make everyone happy.</p>
<p>There were several grammatical, and spelling errors in this post which make it a little difficult to understand in some spots, but other then that you did a very nice job.</p>

			<p>You had a few mistakes here and there but the idea of your post was very good. You took a classic case of two people that have different views about the confederate flag but it had a twist to it, which was the SOUTHERN principal that was against the confederate flag and thought it should be banned from school or not. If everybody thought the way he did then we would have many less arguments about it today between people with different approaches to the idea. You were very neutral about the whole thing. Good job.</p>

			<p>Your post was good but it would have been better if the article links would have been embeded when you started to talk about the article.  I liked the first article because the schools could say that what kind of clothing they could were and which ones they couldn&#8217;t is not right.  To some people the flag is symbol of something important and to some it is an insult but it is for that person to decide if it is right for him/her.  And the second article you did quote that said america is a free country and i do agree with it and you should be able to do what ever you wanted.</p>

			<p>I enjoyed reading your post, you had some grammatical errors though. I think the confederate flag should be banned because it is not what we stand for and it is not the flag that we use now, so I see no point in using it. Just because the flag reminds people of history doesn&#8217;t mean it is right to display it, displaying it means that you support it and believe in what it stands for.</p>

			<p>The flag represents being united. Meaning all the citizens of the country sulute one flag. In this case the American flag, which represents everything we stand for as a country, as a whole. The confederate flag holds a meaning to many southern states who celebrate it for the history of there ancestors. I feel it should not be looked down upon as long as people see the confederate flag as representive of there past ancestors. Although on the other hand it should be a crime to waive the flag around if you do it out of hate or think it represents slavery. In this case the confederate flag was defeated to uphold the law and get rid of slavery. I do not think everybody in the south is raciest, however I can bet there are many people who would not to see forigners or any other colored people around.</p>

			<p>Your post confused me a little bit. I think you spent too much  time summarizing the articles, and not enough time explaining your thoughts on the issue. I do agree that if we look past the negative connotation that the flag holds, we can use it as a learning tool, but I don&#8217;t see it actually happening. People are too set in their ways, and I don&#8217;t think that they would be willing to surrender their feelings towards the flag, especially if their feelings involve hatred, in order to respect the flag for it&#8217;s history. You made a good point, I just don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s conceivable.</p>

			<p>I liked your post, you did an excellent job displaying both sides of the argument. I&#8217;m not sure if this confederate flag situation will ever be completely resolved. Their will always be skeptics and proponents on the issue of the flag. I don&#8217;t agree that people should be getting in criminal trouble by wearing the flag, but i think the flag will always be seen as a symbol of racism to the African-American community, which is why I believe states should ban the flag in the public. I feel that some of the proponents of the flag do so because they want to create controversy and thus do it for the wrong reason. I liked your post&#8230;.</p>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>If you were to hear &#8220;New World Order,&#8221; its likely that you would think of one of two things. One possibility would be a very trashy t-shirt with the face of some ogre sized, anabolic steroid using, &#8216;professional&#8217; wrestler. This article of clothing, I use that term loosely, usually adorns a person who believes that wrestling is truly REAL! On the other hand if you are anything like myself, which I know many of you are, you would probably think of something with a bit of sustenance, something like a huge conspiracy theory that has possibly taken over our government and way of thinking. NEW WORLD ORDER and the super secret Freemasons, Illuminated Ones, Knights Templar. . . you know stuff that we dabble in a tad bit in courses but don&#8217;t get to really get in to the psychotic nitty gritty of.<strong> The symbolism and aesthetics throughout Washington DC were designed upon principles and beliefs tied deeply in Freemasonry, but the overall layout, intentional or not,  does indeed contain a bulk of occult imagery.</strong></p>
<p>It is undeniable that the Masonic Compass and Square are prevalent in a map of our nations capital. Illustrated by this <a title="map" href="http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/False%20Religions/Illuminati/satan_dc.png">map</a>, we can easily see that that White House, U.S. Capitol, Washington Monument, Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials make up what is a to scale rendition of the Masonic Compass and square seen <a title="here." href="http://cura.free.fr/xxv/22ed3.gif">here</a>. This could be easily associated to the fact that many of our founding fathers were part of the Freemasons and they possibly wanted to leave their mark on what they built. That still leaves the also obvious pentagram extending North of the White House and many other satanic aspects of the design unexplained.</p>
<p>There is large speculation that the planners of Washington DC used &#8216;templates&#8217; to model the capital city that they were building. These templates being, <a title="The Kabbalistic Tree of Life" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Tree_of_life_wk_02.jpg">The Kabbalistic Tree of Life</a>, <a title="Metatron's Cube," href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ee/Metatrons_cube.svg">Metatron&#8217;s Cube</a>, and <a title="The Great Pyramid Cross Section" href="http://www.book-of-thoth.com/thebook/images/thumb/600px-Fig_1.jpg">The Great Pyramid Cross Section</a>. These images overlayed with the map pose an interesting little debacle with all sorts of ties astrology and religion. All of the renditions, and more information can be found at <a href="http://www.startiming.net/cave/wdc-1.html">Famous (and no so famous) Pentagrams in Washington DC</a> and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/jussaymoe/dc_symbolism/">Masonic and Kabbalistic Symbols in the Washington DC map</a> . While there is a great deal of speculation to what is actually true and what is false, I&#8217;m going to stick to what I found at the monuments that make up the Masonic Square and Compass. Due to a freak puddle jumping accident a week prior of our journey, my co-conspiracy theorist / Human GPS / Photographer had broken his leg, obviously his walking abilities were impaired, so we only got to physically visit three of the five destinations. The Washinton Monument, The White House, and The Jefferson Memorial.</p>
<p>The Washington Monument lies directly West of the Capitol in a straight line with it and the four sides of the monument are aligned with the cardinal directions. While it was built in tribute of George Washington, The Father of Our Country, there is also underlying occult symbolisms within it&#8217;s praise. The height of the Washington Monument above ground, is 555.5 feet tall and 55.5 feet wide at its base. Here we see a 1:10 ratio, a common ratio found in obelisks built by the Egyptians, from whom the design may have been borrowed. The Ancient Egyptians considered the obelisk where the sun god&#8217;s spirit resided. If you read in depth one of those links you will recall the Ancient Egyptian Sun God, Ra, is referred to as Satan in the bible. As if that were not enough, if you take the height and width and multiply them by 12, effectively converting the measurement from feet to inches, you end up with 6,666 inches and 666 inches respectively. Occult representation here being that we all know that 666 represents the mark of the Beast, or Satan himself. <a href="http://www.incapabledesetaire.com/edito/secretwash.htm">Other</a> speculations are that the Monument is actually a solar calendar that goes along with the Mayan Calendar and prophecies, whilst it doesn&#8217;t really support my claim, nor does it refute it, but this is definitely something to think about.</p>
<p>To the normal citizen the White House is the house in which The President of the United States resides. For the conspirator, we see that maybe the president isn&#8217;t whom we believe him to be. The <a title="Inverted Pentagram" href="http://home.hiwaay.net/~jalison/wsh5.jpg">inverted Pentagram</a>, who&#8217;s apex falls right upon the White House is very apparent in this map. Although pentagrams were not originally signs of evil or occult nature, in early times they were actually used to ward evil, the one pictured is inverted. In religion the inversion of symbols is Satanic in nature, think about how the inverted cross represents the opposite of what it usually does.  It also seems very similar to this image of the <a href="http://www.cuttingedge.org/news/goathead.gif">Goathead Pentagram</a>. The upper four points of the pentagram are represenative of the four elements of the world, Earth, Fire, Water, Air, while the fifth point on the bottom represents the spirit of Lucifer. The far left and right points of the pentagram are formed by Washington Circle and Mt. Vernon Square. The top three points of the pentagram, <a href="http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/chapter3/dupont_circle.jpg">Dupont Circle</a>, <a href="http://freemasonrywatch.org/pics/logan_circle.jpg">Logan Circle</a>, and <a href="http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/chapter3/scott_circle.jpg">Scott Circle</a> in the center also exhibit occult underlying. From the images you can see that each of these three circles intersects six major streets. 666, now the whole coincidence excuse is getting a little weary. The question begging to be answered here is why would anyone in their right mind want to associate the spirit of Lucifer with the White House?</p>
<p>The Jefferson Memorial, which completes the other leg of the Masonic Compass, was a much different memorial than the previous two. The overall design seemed to be from a different architectural stand point or era than that of the Washington Monument and the White House. From the map it seems as if the monument is fairly aligned with the White House, and if you measure a straight line from the center of the White House to the Center of the Jefferson Memorial, you end up with a length of 1776 meters. Interestingly enough, if you have a dollar bill, look at the base of the pyramid, the roman numerals translate out to 1776. While not necessarily a occult referecne, we can see that the Freemason ties are in everything from our money to our monuments.</p>
<p>The appearance of the Freemason Compass and Square in our nations capital is just an inkling in to part of what many believe is a conspiracy by &#8217;secret rulers.&#8217; With satanic sybolism polluting our nations capital, its a little hard to deny what I&#8217;ve uncovered while doing this assignment. Whether or not these symbols were intentional by design is a question that can be argued for years. The only way to truely comprehend what is going on, would be to know everything about Freemasonry, everything about astrology, everything about architecture, and lots and lots of history. At that point you would probably know too much and the Freemasons would have you killed so that they can continue their plan of World Dominance without your meddling.</p>

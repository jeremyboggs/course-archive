				<p>The National Mall is home to much more than just the standard postcard sites of The Washington Monument and The Lincoln Memorial. There are many smaller monuments hidden among the trees that no one sees because they aren&#8217;t as advertised or well known. <strong>Many people really don&#8217;t care about what Memorials stand for.</strong> This can be shown through either lack of interest or, in rare cases, outright disrespect. Although, I can only imagine that disrespect is limited to immature youth and that adults would have the sense not to do such things.</p>
<p>I start with a look at the World War II and Lincoln Memorials to show how many people come out to see the big memorials, even on days of poor weather. (Both days I went, the weather was either cold or rainy) I show various reasons why people visit. In the case of the World War II Memorial, many veterans came that day to pay their respects.</p>
<p>The next memorial I show is the Korean War Memorial. Here, I continue to show why people come to see the memorials, but I also show some minor bits of disrespect towards the memorial. One such disrespect is the practice of throwing coins in the fountain, but I will chalk that up to ignorance as opposed to disrespect.</p>
<p>The World War I Memorial is shown next, with nearly no people around. The lack of care and renovation is apparent with stained marble and grass sprouting between the cracks of the walkway.</p>
<p>I combined the many pieces of work around the Vietnam Memorial as part of the memorial as they all deal with aspects of the Vietnam War. Some pieces are well known and are the subject of many pictures, and memorials of individual people. Others however are seen rarely, or glossed over as &#8220;What is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>The final site is the Memorial of the 56 Signers of the US Declaration of Independence. There were more birds than people here when I visited. And at one point, two people showed up and picked a flower. They said something along the lines of &#8220;There&#8217;s no entry here,&#8221; though I&#8217;m not really sure what that person was saying. I don&#8217;t even think they knew where they were.</p>
<p>Anyway, pictures speak louder than words, so <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/89546203@N00/sets/72157600183865422/">have a look.<br />

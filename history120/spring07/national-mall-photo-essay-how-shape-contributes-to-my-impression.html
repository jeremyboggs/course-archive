				<p>Since early civilizations, the circle was believed to be a symbol that represented a binding force.  Ultimately, it became a symbol for perfection, the unity of self, and the heart of humanity.  In my opinion, the circle represents consistency, a never-ending cycle, but most importantly harmony.  The peace symbol shows significance of a circular shape because it stands for tranquility.  Thus, I feel circles represent a tight bond that keeps ties together.  <strong>My particular impression of the National Mall illustrates how history symbolizes a theme of unity through the use of exquisite details arranged in a circular form.</strong></p>
<p>The Lincoln Memorial symbolizes unity because a huge sculpture of Lincoln sits on a high chair that is placed in the center overlooking everyone.  I chose the Lincoln Memorial because he led our country to independence and was courageous to speak his mind despite what others thought.  The Lincoln sculpture is placed in the center of the memorial so that tourists can gather around it and rejoice together for his strong leadership.  When I walked into the memorial, I saw everyone circling around together embracing Lincoln’s sculpture which made me feel a sense of unity.  There were also columns that surrounded the Lincoln sculpture and above them were 36 states that were in union at the time of Lincoln’s death.  This shows that the Lincoln Memorial was built with much detail, paying close attention to the significance of numbers.   To further signify the circle, there was also a painting of the north and south unity on the north wall.</p>
<p>The World War II Memorial was designed in a circular shape using pillars as a tribute to our nation.  The pillars were made with exquisite detail because it was built for the 56 states and territories that fought during the WWII generation.  In the middle of this memorial, there are also semicircular waterfalls and fountains that gravitates people to it and gathers everyone together.  Each pillar also had a wreath adorned with oak and wheat to commemorate the nations that fought during the war.  The wreaths are placed to honor the victory of the WWII generation.  A circular pathway was engulfed around the pillars so that tourists could be more engaged to the site and show their gratitude and appreciation.</p>
<p>The George Washington Monument pays particular attention to detail using 50 flagpoles that symbolizes each state in the Union.  Each state&#8217;s flag encircles the perimeter of the monument, creating a circular shape that signifies unity.  I chose the George Washington Monument because he, just like Lincoln, led our country to independence.  Perhaps that is why this is the tallest building that overlooks the District of Columbia.  This monument is roughly 555’ high and can be seen standing from any angle or distance at the National Mall.  The height shows the prominence of our first president.  The pyramid shaped Egyptian obelisk points to the sky which gave me a sense of freedom.  The height of this monument definitely symbolizes unity because everyone can look at the monument without having to stand at a particular place.  Knowing that many other people were looking at the building at the same time made me feel a sense of togetherness and warmth.  Since the George Washington Monument stands so high, it gives people an opportunity to embrace it in unison.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Lincoln Memorial, World War II Memorial, and the George Washington Monument symbolize unity because they are all constructed in circular forms.  Even though the Lincoln Memorial was not exactly designed in a circular shape, it was made so that tourists could gather in a circle around the Lincoln sculpture.  Thus, these memorials were designed so that people could reflect and acknowledge our prominent leaders in America and the people who sacrificed their lives during the war.  The designers paid much attention to the use of details that further helped us to honor our history, and acknowledge our heroic people.  All the numbers used in the sites had a valuable reason for its significance.  Furthermore, the circles are a portrayal of unity which brings people together to reminisce about our past, and the exquisite details enable us to pay particular attention to our history.</p>

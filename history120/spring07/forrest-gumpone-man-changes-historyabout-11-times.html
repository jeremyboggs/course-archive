				<p>Forrest Gump: One Man Changes History…about 11 times<br />
Forrest Gump, the Academy Award winning movie, is by far one of the most intelligent and intriguing movies ever made about 20<sup>th</sup> century history. Taken from a personal view point rather than an overview, Forrest Gump traces the experiences of one man who always seems to find himself blissfully unaware of his constant presence at some of America’s most significant historical events throughout the 1960’s, 70’s, and 80’s. From his medal-worthy Vietnam endeavors until the birth of his first son, <strong>Forrest <u>Gump </u>provides an intelligent view of American History’s most important events as a backdrop to a colorful biography.<br />
</strong>Gump’s first major experience is playing college football for the University of Alabama. This is historically significant because at the time in which this took place, college football was a true Americana-type accomplishment. Gump’s football acted as a catalyst for his meeting the President. One of the most hilarious scenes is Gump’s lack of awareness at the importance of the president when he decides to say on national television that he “has to pee.” Director Robert Zemeckis creates a true nostalgic feel by blending actual footage of President John. F. Kennedy which has been modified to include Forrest as a member of the guests.<br />
On his graduation from the University of Alabama, Gump is recruited into the army in order to fight in the Vietnam War. The Vietnam War was not only one of the biggest political hot-buttons of the 60’s, but perhaps one of the greatest in America’s history. The Vietnam War was fought primarily on the basis of protecting America’s overseas interests and protecting America’s way of life overseas. The Vietnam War was also responsible for one of the biggest reaction groups, known as hippies. Hippies were just a small microcosm of large groups who constantly protested the Government’s decision to remain in Vietnam. Gump, highly regarded medal-of-honor recipient somehow gets caught amongst a protest rally, once again, blissfully unaware. Mistaking him for someone speaking against the war, the hippies allow him to speak on the war in front of the reflecting pool. However, none of these hippies are able to hear what he says because of audio problems.<br />
Although throughout Forrest’s life, he is constantly experiencing incredible memories as viewed by the audience. But due to his mental capacity, he often does not realize the level of the importance of the moments going on around him. HE foregoes the fact that he is selected to visit communist China as a life crowning moment. Winning the Medal of Honor, something very few people have ever done, is not the greatest moment of his life. To him, the greatest part of his life is marrying Jenny and being a father.  According to Forrest, He is “not a smart man” but he knows what love is. And in the face of his incredible life, that’s all that ever mattered to him.<br />
For risk of this becoming a simple summary, it is important to discuss why Forrest Gump is such as success. Although Forrest Gump is full of history that defined America, its historical accuracy is far off. But, that’s the point. Rather than stick to cut-and-dry facts of history, i.e. who was responsible for breaking open the Watergate scandal, Forrest Gump provides more of a “what-if-it-happened-like-this” type feel. For example: What if Forrest Gump was responsible for the exposing of Watergate and the subsequent decline of Richard Nixon’s presidency. What if Forrest was responsible for creating one of the worlds’ most recognizable and marketable symbols; the smiley face? And what if he created it by accident? Clearly, none of these historical events happened in this manner. By avoiding facts, and creating human interest blended with historical events, Forrest Gump proves to be a cinematic masterpiece filled with drama, and love in which the history that makes it so great has really no effect on the character.</p>

			<p>This post is good and very well written. For the people that haven’t seen the movie, I suggest them to read this post because it is helpful and the facts from the movie will tell the reader what they are going to see. I remember the time when I first saw this movie. This quote “life is like a box of chocolates” became the “it” quote during that time. The moment I read this post, I automatically thought of this parade that took place in Washington D.C in remembrance of Memorial Day. In the parade, there was this guy that fought during the Vietnam War and had his life based on actual facts in the movie. What I like about this post is that they included important facts that Forest Gump has experience during his life. Also, the main fact that “he often does not realize the level of the importance of the moments going on around him”. What I don’t like about this post is that the author didn’t really critique the movie. Instead, the post author included the important facts that Forest Gump had gone through during his life.</p>

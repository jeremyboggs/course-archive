				<h2><a href="/courses/history120/spring07/cold-mountain.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Cold Mountain">Cold Mountain</a></h2>
				<small>April 4th, 2007 <!-- by shwanga --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>          “Cold Mountain” takes place during the Civil War in North Carolina when the men living in this area are rushed to join the Confederate Army.  This movie portrays Ada’s, a woman who falls in love with Inman, perspective on the war while waiting for her love’s return.  She continues writing letters to him while he is fighting, but he doesn’t respond back to her.  <strong>Hence, “Cold Mountain” shows a historical sense and makes viewers sympathize for Inman by portraying his heroism, and by showing a struggling love story as he is separated from Ada.<br />
</strong>          I feel this movie does not necessarily show which army is the good or bad side.  Although it shows Inman’s heroism, he does not account for the rest of the Confederate army.  Like the previous example, people in the same army found quarrels amongst themselves finding traitors instead of helping each other.  For example, in a particular scene when one of the men who escaped was found, they killed the man’s family and tormented his mom by tying her hands onto a log and stomping on it.  This scene also signifies a historical sense of how people in the same confederate sides could go against each other, so it was hard to trust anyone.  To make us sympathize, there are many brutal clips of innocent men crying in agonizing pain when wounded.  Their rivals in the Union army are not completely shown as horrible people.  In a particular scene when Inman is searching for shelter he is welcomed by a mother who provides him with hospitality.  When the Union army came into the home looking for food, one of the men in the troop raped the mother, but the other man tried to help the baby from being cold. Thus, there is no right or good side portrayed in this movie.  All the people during this time in the Civil War were just struggling to survive, struggling to return back to their families, struggling because of hunger; they were all in the same circumstance.  Traitors were most likely caught and dawned with revenge.<br />
             One of the ways this movie illustrates a historical interpretation is by interpreting the word “masculinity” without agreeing to society’s perspective of men.  In order for men to be “masculine” in society today, the media portrays that men should not be shown vulnerable; they should not show their emotions publicly or they are considered weak.  Inman shows that he is courageous in another way.  He shows emotion and pain when he risks his life trying to save two of his fellow companions fighting in the war.  He gets shot once when he tries to save his friend who had already died.  In this way, Inman is illustrated as a caretaker who is compassionate for others. He is also shown vulnerable when he is alone, homeless and hungry escaping from the war.  He begs for shelter, depicting the role of manhood society stresses.<br />
             Because “Cold Mountain” also illustrates a love story, this movie helps viewers to side with Inman’s survival so that he could return to Ada.  A significant scene is when Ada’s father dies in the rain, and she is left by herself.  Ada’s image changes as very frail and extremely thin.  Her hair isn’t as neatly braided; she is easily frightened, and isolates herself in her house.  There is one scene showing Ada eating like a homeless person that starved many days as she hurriedly gulps the soup her friend made.  Showing this drastic character change in Ada makes viewers hope for Inman’s return back home so that she wouldn’t loose everyone important to her.   <br />
          In conclusion, “Cold Mountain” portrays the time of the Civil War in a historical and realistic sense.  The movie doesn’t stress which side is good because it wants to show the reality of war.  To not twist the facts around it shows that soldiers in the Confederate and Union army have a good and a bad side.  I believe the purpose of this movie was to make it seem as historically accurate as possible; taking a particular side would mean only seeing war through one perspective. “Cold Mountain” illustrates that soldiers can relate to their experience fighting in the war despite what side they fought.  Both sides struggled the same way with traitors, family left behind, hunger, and a constant need for security.   It shows graphical scenes of men constantly fighting in gruesome wars, and families awaiting their loved ones for a safe return back home.  This movie is realistic in that it illustrates the struggle for Inman and Ada; a struggle for a solider forced into the war and a struggle for a woman waiting for his return home.  For instance, she is trying to cope living on her own after her father’s death with Inman gone.  It was interesting how the movie did such a great job in portraying how everyone during this era was bound to suffer.  “Cold Mountain” does a phenomenal job in illustrating that a man can still be honorable even though he shows vulnerability.</p>

				<h2><a href="/courses/history120/spring07/advertising-and-social-acceptance.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Advertising and Social Acceptance">Advertising and Social Acceptance</a></h2>
				<small>April 3rd, 2007 <!-- by brushia --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Advertising has been a source of media that can be used to see the social trends of different times by seeing what is being portrayed in advertising.<strong>Throughout advertising history, a focus has been given to selling products with a promise of social acceptance, because not being accepted socially is a major individual fear for most people.</strong><br />
One advertisement that uses social acceptance as a selling point is this <a title="Barbasol ad" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/74908776@N00/445142920/">Barbasol ad</a>. This advertisement is selling Barbasol shaving cream, and depicts a bride-to-be talking with her mother about the man she is about to marry. It is implied that the mother is complaining that the man is not rich. The woman&#8217;s reply to this, which is printed is &#8221; but he doesn&#8217;t have to be rich, mother. He&#8217;s got a Barbasol Face!&#8221; This sends out the message to men that being poor will hinder them from finding a wife, unless of course they use Barbasol shaving cream. The advertisement plays on the insecurities men have about not being rich, and shows that with Barbasol that they too can get a beautiful wife as easily as a rich man. It is interesting to note that the image depicted is of the mother altering the wedding dress for the bride. That practice was a lot more common in those days than it is now, and reflects back on the time in which it was made. Also, it is interesting that the advertisement focuses on marraige, because in mainstream culture in those days portraying sex was still taboo. An example of this is in television of that time where couples slept in different beds.</p>
<p>Fast-forwarding to today, another hygiene advertisement is this <a title="Axe ad" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/74908776@N00/445142934/">Axe ad</a>. This advertisement is for Axe body spray, and depicted in the image is a cracked open apartment door with a ticket machine attached that says &#8220;Take a number&#8221; as would be found in a grocery store. This ad is insinuating that this guy who owns the apartment uses axe body spray, and is flocked by so many girls because of this, that he had to put a ticket machine on his door. Further insinuation is that the door is cracked open, because the girls come and go so rapidly that he doesn&#8217;t even have time to close the door. This is selling the social acceptance of the female sex towards the male who wears Axe body spray. It is saying that if a man wears Axe, he will be flocked by women wanting to have sex with him. This shows an interesting contrast with the Barbasol advertisement. In the more prude times the Barbasol ad uses marraige, and in the the more sexually overdosed present, the promise of multiple sexual partners is presented.</p>
<p>A third advertisement that uses social acceptance as a selling point is this advertisement for <a title="Courtley Toiletries ad" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/74908776@N00/445142926/">Courtley Toiletries</a>. The ad shows the Courtley Toiletries set in a very regal setting, characterized by the dark red and gold colors. Also displayed prominently are two gold-outlined horses. Owning horses throughout time has signified wealth and prominence, because they are an expensive endeavor. In addition, the text shown in the largest font on the advertisement states, &#8220;First choice of men who know.&#8221; This makes it seem like there is a high-class backing of this product, and any man who chooses to buy this product will be considered high-class. This advertisement promises the social acceptance of the high class, which many men dream of one day becoming a part of.</p>
<p>The fourth ad that uses social acceptance as a selling point is this <a title="Michelob Beer ad" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/74908776@N00/445142928/">Michelob Beer ad</a>. This ad is selling Michelob Beer with the tagline &#8220;Lose the carbs. Not the taste.&#8221; Also depicted in the background, is a physically fit man doing sit-ups. This ad insinuates that if you choose to drink Michelob Beer, you will become physically fit, while you will gain pounds by drinking other beers. In the society of today, there is an &#8220;obesity epidemic&#8221;, and also thanks to modern popular media, there is a great social importance on being healthy, fit, and not fat. Those of larger structure have a greater tendency to be insecure about their weight, and being accepted into modern society with that weight. This advertisement plays into those insecurities by promising that by drinking their beer one can get fit, and be wholly accepted by society.</p>
<p>Whether being accepted by a future wife, the opposite sex, a group of people, or society as a whole, social acceptance is a grand part of human existence. Throughout many different changes within the different idealogies of different times, the fear of not being accepted is a constant.</p>

					<div align="left">These days everyone knows the all too familiar &#8216;whoosh whoosh&#8217; spray noise of that magical formula known as body spray. To some the smell is pleasant and refreshing, but many find it utterly disgusting and most definitely not the substitute for a good ol&#8217; fashion shower. Through the use of sex appeal marketing companies like Proctor Gamble and Gillette have skyrocketed their sales of body sprays through the roof. The fact is, this is an old marketing strategy that worked flawlessly and continues to set the standard today. <strong>Ads that contain sex appeal in their marketing strategy sell products better than others because sex and being perceived as sexy is an issue that humans deal with everyday.</strong></div>
<p>In 1969, Old Spice, another large competitor in current body spray production, released <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7692746@N08/444432087/">this ad,</a> in Playboy magazine. The ad portrays a black and white photo of Maggie Perkins in a field, with the quote &#8220;Maggie Perkins thinks guys who wear Old Spice understand what women like.&#8221; This alone presents the assumption that by wearing Old Spice, Maggie Perkins will automatically think you understand what women like and in turn be more desirable by women. In small print after that statement it states  &#8220;Girls like it. Is there a better reason to wear Old Spice?&#8221; Here the assumption is that since Maggie Perkins likes it, all girls do, so you should wear it, so that girls like you. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7692746@N08/444432079/">Hai Karate</a>, another Cologne / After Shave of the 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s chose the &#8216;Danger&#8217; tactic typically found in product marketing today. The ad pictures a bottle of Hai Karate after shave and a disclaimer next to it bearing the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7692746@N08/444432077/">warning</a> &#8220;Don&#8217;t dare use Hai Karate&#8230; without memorizing this.&#8221; The disclaimer goes on to explain how to fend off and immobilize an advancing female that may have fallen in to a trance through your use of this intense scent. &#8220;Be careful how you use it,&#8221; the products main catch phrase, is printed at the bottom of the ad in an eye catching larger font. Through the use of outlets like Playboy Magazine, this type of advertisement was mainly directed at single heterosexual young men, especially those that just passed through puberty and were ready to start mingling with girls. If you wanted to get girls, this is what you wanted to be wearing. Recently the trend of sexual advertising has hit an all time high with ads like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7692746@N08/444426456/">this,</a> from Gillette. This particular ad depicts what seems to be a normal Christmas Dinner, with the exception that the son of the family is being mounted by a girl who is intoxicated by his scent of Tag Body Spray. In the background you can see that it is accepted by the father, seen decorating the tree, yet has a large grin on his face from what is happening. Accompanied next to the father is the mother, with a surprised / disgusted face, and in the foreground by grandma, who seems to be having a slight heart attack from what she is witnessing. We see the classic use of the &#8216;WARNING&#8217; sign and disclaimer that was seen on the Hai Karate Ad from the past. Similarly this other <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7692746@N08/444432131/in/photostream/">Tag Ad,</a> also uses the same classic tactic, but with a little twist. This Ad depicts a young man being tackled by an entire womens volleyball team. The warning claims that the company has no responsibility for the actions of women around you when you use their product. It also has a witty little cut out card that the ad advises you to carry around if you are a user of the body spray. The card states &#8220;If I am clinically injured in a TAG related pile-on, please notify my buddy ________ @ (___)____-______. (He&#8217;ll find it hilarious).&#8221; The general consensus of the four ads is pretty similar. If you wear the product, girls will like you and you will in turn probably get laid. Who doesn&#8217;t want to get laid?</p>
<p>Overall the marketing strategy of sex is one that has played a active role in advertising. It seemed to work well in the past and it continues to work equally now. Not only is sex a part of life that everyone knows about, but its an issue that manifests itself earlier and earlier in the lives of teens in todays society. Sex sells, it always has and it probably always will. Even though everyone knows that just because you use these products you won&#8217;t have the same results as the commercial, it still puts the product on a pedestal in your mind. The next time you go to the store are you going to buy a boring can of baby powder to keep you dry and fresh or are you going to pick up that &#8216;whoosh whoosh&#8217; can of TAG that is advertised oh so well? The choice is easy.</p>

					<p>Ads are used to sell a product to the masses, hopefully, it will tell them what it does and/or how it works. Sometimes the ads need help in convincing people. So companies get someone else to sell for them. <strong>Companies use celebrities to help sell a product because they have more prestige than the company themselves.</strong></p>
<p>In two ads, (both from 1925) a person that is more famous than the “Average Joe” is used to push a product. The people are quoted liking the product. In <a title="Pond's Extract ad" href="http://flickr.com/photos/89546203@N00/439112410/">Pond’s Extract ad</a>, a Queen says “beauty can be thoroughly guarded bye Pond’s Two Creams.” Someone that wants to be as beautiful as this queen want to use the products she uses to try to be like a queen.  In the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/89546203@N00/439112408/">Lux soap ad</a>, the “Cabinet babies,” (children of the Secertay of Labor in 1925) are deemed as “Lux babies” because all of their clothes are washed in Lux soap. Also, Mark Twain is quoted that his suits are “as white, and clean, and pure, and soft as swan’s down.” People of the time want to use what products celebrities use so they can be like them. All that is really different today is that “celebrity” has a broader definition.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for ad agencies of today, some people are wise to the fact that they hire celebrities to say whatever they are paid to say. Sometimes, they choose a “real life customer” to advocate a service, though some people suspect that these are no name actors doing this for money. In this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em-b0wQzQ-0">Geico ad</a>, they choose to blend the best of both worlds and have both a celebrity and a normal person, the normal person speaking normal English, while the celebrity elaborates in some weird exaggeration. Sometimes, ads will stick with the traditional celebrity angle, like this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Wo1D1M3Tps">ad for Cup Noodles</a>, run only in Japan.  As opposed, to stating that they use this product, which would obviously be scripted, the celebrity now appears in commercials to just be there because a normal person might not give the right “image” for an item. What if it was some no name American lifting the huge tea kettles in the Cup Noodle commercial? Then the consumer may not be able to identify with what is being sold.</p>

					<p>Every race has a few stereotypes that follow them where they go.  From Asian people being good at math to Jewish people being very greedy with money, stereotypes have no mercy.  It is very difficult not to offend anyone since there are so many people, keeping racism a touchy subject.  Even in class, when we talk about race or a group of people, we know what the answers are or what the professor is looking for, but since that race is represented in the class, we do not want to offend them and simply try not to be called on.  <strong>Stereotypes label races a certain way and that certain way is how the majority of the population see them as.</strong></p>
<p>A few things have changed, since the 19<sup>th</sup> century, but there still remain stereotypes that continue to label races in order to simplify things.  I found a few pictures in the Library of Congress archives that depict typical <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/436320671/in/photostream/">African-American</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/436320677/in/photostream/">Chinese-Americans</a> in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century.  In the picture with the small child enjoying his watermelon, you see a large chunk of it already eaten.  As you know, African-Americans like watermelon, chicken, and grits, this has been a stereotype for a long time and is even the title to the Nappy Roots album, “Watermelon, Chicken, &amp; Gritz” with a “z” because it makes it that much cooler.  The little boy, named “Watermelon Jake”, is not wearing any shoes and appears to be sitting on a table.  So at this time period, African-Americans are poor people who cannot afford shoes and enjoy watermelon in the summer time to keep them cool.</p>
<p>In the other photo, entitled “The Chinese Must Go!” there are several small pictures showing several stereotypes of Chinese people.  In one picture, there is a line of people waiting to hand there clothes to the Chinese cleaner man who is already hard at work.  In another picture, there is a man inspecting the clothes that a Chinese tailor has finished for him.  In yet another picture, there is a man looking to buy cigars in a Chinese owned Cigar shop.  These are stereotypes of jobs that the Chinese had and in every single picture, they are still wearing their typical Chinese clothing, while the white people have regular trousers, coats, hats, and shoes.</p>
<p>Some of these stereotypes are still valid today.  Of course some of them are not also.  In a photo that I found in the Google search engine, there is a picture of <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/436332436/in/photostream/">Tupac</a>.  This “Gangsta” rapper emerged late in the 20<sup>th</sup> century to become one of the biggest rap icons in history.  This photo also depicts what a typical gangster is, I guess, supposed to look like.  From a huge tattoo across his stomach stating, “THUG LIFE” with a bullet as the letter “i”, to his jeans slung low passed his boxer briefs, to his backwards bandana.  Yet he finds it necessary to wear a crucifix outside of it all.  This “thug” was later gunned down in 1996 in a drive by with his murder yet to be solved.  So when Tupac became rich and famous, he wore better clothes, had more jewelry and was very influential in the music world, but little Watermelon Jake was just a little kid with no shoes enjoying his juicy watermelon.</p>
<p>In the last photo, I found what appears to be a web advertisement for a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/436332440/in/photostream/">Chinese tailor</a>.  There are dressed in there traditional clothing and the older man is working on a piece of clothing in the background.  The bottom of the picture states “We don’t have a fancy website, but we make the most beautiful dresses.”  It also says that they are made by hand.  This made me think, “Did they wear those clothes on purpose to attract customers?”  You want to make money when you start a business, but I do not think that you have to wear something or look a certain way that you would not normally look in order to attract customers, your work should speak for itself.</p>
<p>Stereotyping is a serious problem that people have dealt with for a very long time.  Some of these stereotypes, although there is some truth, hold back the race from breaking free of the mold that society have put them in.  There are a few pioneers, such as Dave Chappelle, Carlos Mencia, and the creators of South Park that have confronted stereotypes and made them public so that everyone knows what it does.  Now I’m going to get out of my house that has like 20 people in it, drive to school in my Toyota Corolla with Wal-Mart spinners, and stop by Taco Bell before I get to class.</p>

					<p>By definition, a stereotype is a simplified and standardized conception or image invested with special meaning and held in common by members of a group [1]. They can be harmful or beneficial, correct or incorrect, and have been used for many different reasons. Furthermore, stereotypes are always in flux as they are modified to conform to changes in society over time. <strong>Yet, from nineteenth century to present day America, stereotypes have always performed a certain type of “cultural work”, in that they have always been used to define and protect the individuality and uniqueness of any given culture. </strong></p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, the United States experienced a major surge of immigration from foreign cultures that were markedly different than the existing American culture. These immigrants, who were abundant in Irish-Catholics and Chinese, posed a threat by compromising what natives had previously developed as the “American” culture. As a response, immigrants were often mocked and stereotyped in cartoons of newspapers in order to distinguish American traits from alien traits. An example of this can be seen in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44181017@N00/436035716/">this</a> 1880 cartoon from the magazine, <em>Harper’s Weekly</em>, where a Chinese man is depicted coming to America in a tea pot while saying “How e do Melican man. Me comme plenty time. Bling big heap Chineeman”. By using the teapot as a symbol for Chinese culture, this cartoon implies that the Chinese are making America their own home, and not conforming to traditional American values. By pointing out and making fun of the Chinese man’s poor grammar, and exaggerating unfamiliar stereotypical physical features such as clothing, facial structure, and hairstyle, the author helps define what is not American. Thus, in return, stereotypes such as these protect what is American by not allowing alien cultures to blend in. </p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the Chinese were not the only threat to American culture. In fact, prior to the mass immigration of Chinese, Irish-Catholics were the major threat to the existing American culture, which was mainly Protestant. Protestant Americans were afraid the growing number of Catholics would become too influential, and possibly seize control of the government. In magazine cartoons such as <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44181017@N00/436035716/">this</a>, which was also found in <em>Harper’s Weekly</em>, the stereotype that the Irish were ape-like barbarians that were prone to drunkenness and lawlessness was reinforced time and time again. Depicting them in this animalistic manner made all Irish seem untrustworthy, and fueled anti-Catholic notions. This widespread negative preconceived notion about the Irish kept them in check, and helped minimize their influence among American society. Also, by making fun of the drunken, disorderly behavior of the Irish, Americans at the same time were defining themselves as level headed, in control people. </p>
<p>In present day times, America has become a melting pot society. It has become more and more homogenous, and people of different cultures are beginning to lose their discrete identities. As a result, overtly racist stereotypes in newspapers and media (such as the examples above) marginalized significantly in the twentieth century. Yet, stereotypes still do exist today, and are still used to protect traditional cultural values. For example, television commercials often portray the stereotype that drug users are losers, which is a mechanism for promoting a sober, healthy lifestyle to future generations. Similarly, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44181017@N00/436125179/">this</a> image depicts how Uncle Sam teaches us drugs are bad.  Cultural values must be taught to future generations for them to be preserved. Also, because of the melting pot of cultures in today’s America, and the gradual loss of discrete identities among cultures, people sometimes manifest stereotypes given to the group of people they feel most a part of. For instance, if a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44181017@N00/436172883/">Caucasian boy</a> was raised in an African-American community, he or she might wear baggy clothes in hopes to fit in. </p>
<p>As one can see, times have radically changed since nineteenth century America, but stereotypes have always been used to define and protect the individuality and uniqueness of a group’s culture. Throughout history stereotypes have proven to be the cause of many problems and misconceptions, but fortunately, overtly racist ones are becoming less common. But in the end, as long as there are cultural differences, there will also be stereotypes to draw between them.</p>

					<p>A stereotype is a conception or opinion of people made from observations concerning people from a “group”.  Stereotypes can be a positive reflection on a group of people or it can be a nasty reflection. For example, all blondes are stupid, or more seriously, all Jewish people are cheap (negative) or all Asians are smart (positive). Stereotypes are wrong either way since you are saying that every single member of that group is something without knowing any facts. Stereotypes are based on previous experience and then continued on in future experiences with someone different but from that same group. Stereotypes have been around for centuries. Americans did not want the Irish in their country, so instead of understanding them and giving them a chance, they judged them first and formed stereotypes against them. Americans also have seen woman for years as inferior to men, weak, and that they should be only objects that are seen and/or mothers. These and more stereotypes continue on today. New stereotypes of today include, all middle easterners are terrorists and Americans are fat. <strong>Nineteenth Century stereotypes do the same work as stereotypes today; both categorize and both wrongly judge people.</strong> It is not good that stereotypes are still carried on and that new ones are constructed everyday.</p>
<p>In the 1850’s the Irish started trickling over to America to escape poverty and famine, but they were directly unwanted. This can be explained in that Americans were afraid of change and afraid that these illiterate, poor, unskilled people would deteriorate their beloved country that they had recently created. Americans decided to view the Irish as mean, feisty, unruly, and “incapable of becoming American”. They were not given a chance to mingle in society, thus the Irish could not even try to become Americanized. The Irish were viewed the same way the North <a title="Resource" href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/exploring/19thcentury/alienmenace/">viewed</a> the blacks. This stereotype is still accepted today, but a few things have changed. The Irish are still viewed as feisty and rough, but in a more positive way. The “fighting Irish” is a term used to describe them. This <a title="Fighting Irish" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17302319@N00/434589805/in/pool-history120-spring07/">cartoon</a> of the fighting Irish is associated of course with sports. But it depicts the fighting Irish in a good way. Meaning they are tough and will win against the other team. These days being tough and mean are ways of staying alive and surviving. The Irish must have stuck it out and survived since they are welcomed and loved these days. This stereotype changed over time, but not all do.</p>
<p>Women have always been seen as weak, pretty, or just a typical homemaker and mother. Basically one that has no influence on society and an object that should be concerned with appearance. Also, women are seen as those that gossip and talk about things that have no significance. This <a title="19th Century Woman" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17302319@N00/434619175/in/pool-history120-spring07/">picture</a> is from the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Women at that time were seen as inferior to men. They should not work, vote, or have any power. The men were the ones that had all control. Women those days thought their place was at home and taking care of the family because that’s what society was telling them by stereotyping them into this group. Today woman are encouraged to have careers but <a title="Women" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17302319@N00/434619149/in/pool-history120-spring07/">magazines</a> mass advertise ways to look good in the work place. Both photos encourage an attractive appearance and both talk about petty insignificant “gossip”. The magazine clip give secret hints on where to find the best bargains or ways to look pretty in a short time. There is no encouragement to make an impact or columns informing them of important world topics. There are no “hints” on how to work your way to another level in society. Women are still being compressed into the circle of appearance and inferiority.</p>
<p>Stereotypes will forever be present. They may change over time but essentially they still do the same thing, categorize and wrongfully judge. Not all women are concerned with beauty and bargains. Some women work hard and are concerned with politics and ways to improve the world, but it is hard to find help when they are still being seen as pretty objects. I am sure not all Irish men drink and fight regularly. Continuing stereotypes just paves the way for new ones. A new stereotype today is that Americans are fat and infatuated with food, like in this <a title="American Stereotype" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17302319@N00/434589801/in/pool-history120-spring07/">photo</a>. The clip shows a very jolly man, obviously an American, extremely happy to have so much unhealthy food. He does not seem to have another care in the world, he has what he wants. I chose to add this photo because it shows that new stereotypes are created frequently based on the fact that a large number of Americans are overweight. However this leads to an outsider viewing all Americans as overweight. Stereotypes do nothing to fix a problem. Instead they poke fun at the subject and force people to continue to view things the way they are. Stereotypes contribute nothing to society.          </p>

				<small>March 26th, 2007 <!-- by drooney --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Today in the United States certain stereotypes are used arguably for less nefarious reasons than they were in the nineteenth century. That is not to say, however, that modern day stereotypes are any more positive or constructive than those of our past. The stereotype of the lazy, drunken and brawling Irish &#8220;goon&#8221; who looked more like an animal is not significantly more positive to the Irish reputation than the more recent stereotype of the Irish party animal. The difference is that the purposes behind these respective uses of stereotyping are almost complete opposites. <strong>Generally speaking, the &#8220;cultural work&#8221; performed by stereotypes in the nineteenth century was to assist in efforts to exclude and marginalize particular groups who sought acceptance within the American experience, while the &#8220;cultural work&#8221; performed by stereotypes today seems more akin to &#8220;marketing support&#8221; work, aimed at attaching some well known collective attribute to various consumer products for all to enjoy. </strong>While the caricature of the Irish goon was designed and used to keep the Irish outside the bounds of decent American society, the &#8220;party Mick&#8221; is now constantly used to lure others into the happy drinking ways of this lovable member of the big American quilt.</p>
<p>While it would be naive to suggest that there are no longer efforts to exclude and marginalize various groups within the US, it is clear that America is longer a place where overt racism<strong> </strong>can be practiced in the media to the extent it once was in the nineteenth century. The level of social consciousness and moral restraints on overt racism has increased significantly from days ago, and the fact is many ethnic groups that were once on the outside looking in have now worked their way into the current American mainstream. Thus, while attempts to negatively influence the American public’s acceptance of a particular group by way of a blatant stereotype broadcast widely in the mainstream media may have been tolerated in the nineteenth century, they would most likely be regarded as heavy-handed and morally unacceptable in today’s America. In other words, racism and the use of stereotypes in support of racism, must be much more subtle and limited in audience scope today.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the use of stereotypes are powerful ways to communicate a message. Never willing to pass up a way to sell a message, thus, Madison Avenue has made itself all the more effective by playing on the same or similar stereotypes as have persisted through the years - - just with a different twist. This is precisely why, for example, the alcoholic Irishman stereotype has managed to survive. Instead of being portrayed as the feckless, drunken rascal who would bring nothing but crime and disorderly conduct to America, the alcoholic Irishman stereotype has now been watered down a wee bit to represent the new carefree, hard drinking, hard-playing man among men who we should all join and emulate at the nearest bar selling Coors Light. Irish Americans are still being cast as drunks, but they are now acceptable and even lovable – so much so, indeed, that we are all urged to be just like them!</p>
<p>The images I selected to post strongly support the idea that, while stereotypes may stay the same through the years in terms of basic substance, they can change dramatically in terms of their uses and intended purposes. One of the nineteenth century cartoons I posted and the modern day cartoon I posted both address the alcoholic Irishman stereotype. That, however, is where the similarity stops. Clearly, one cartoon intends to use the stereotype to the detriment of the Irish, whereas the recent cartoon seeks to convey a much more positive view of an Irishman with drink in hand. The stereotypical Irish alcoholic who was once an unacceptable threat to decent Americans has apparently been transformed into a vital component of the leisure life of modern America, all through the magic of TV commercials.</p>

				<h2><a href="/courses/history120/spring07/stereotypes-and-women.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Stereotypes and Women">Stereotypes and Women</a></h2>
				<small>March 26th, 2007 <!-- by Nisreen Daoud --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Stereotypes have been a part of the American culture since Englishmen first evaded the country. Stereotypes can be defined as “ideas held about members of particular groups, based solely on membership in that group” (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype">Wikipedia</a>). We are presented with these stereotypes everyday of our lives, and everyday we are pressured to embed these into our culture and lives. Some of the most common stereotypes have to do with women. Throughout history women have had very specific roles that they were forced to play and that is how society has come to portray women. <strong>The “cultural work” that stereotypes did in the nineteenth century is still the same work that is is doing today, which is cause society to view certain groups with these judegements in mind and creates room for even more stereotypes to be made.  </strong></p>
<p>I chose to focus my whole post on the sterotypes that women have and still face today. In my opinion, women have been one of the most discriminated groups in this country throughout  history. The common beliefs behind America was based around men and women struggled to compete. To this day, many women still struggle to maintain their own identities and to create a free life of their own. Consequently, the two stereotypes I focused on are “women are meant to be housewives” and that “being a nurse is a women’s job.”</p>
<p>One of the most significant stereotypes towards women is the fact that “ women are meant to be housewives.” During the nineteenth century, all that women were known for was being housewives and very few actually held positions other than this one. For example, the first picture is an advertisement that does a good job showing this stereotype (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/81916518@N00/430882476/in/photostream/">Housewife</a>). As the world is fighting the famine, her job, as she is a woman, has to do with providing food. In the second picture (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/81916518@N00/430876878/in/photostream/">Housewife 2</a>), we see a more modern day housewife with her duster in hand. The biggest difference between the two pictures is that the today’s housewife looks more worried about her make up then anything else. Which in turn yields the fact that today women not only are supposed to be housewives, but also are supposed to always look good and be ready for anything. As well, both women are seen wearing an apron, leading to that being a sign of cleaning. Both of these made life for women hard, whether in the nineteenth century, or today. It made it hard for women to be taken seriously, which makes it hard for them to break out of their shells and become workingwomen. Men view women as these objects at their disposal and view themselves as the powerhouse. All this in turn makes it hard for women to get jobs and be taken seriously. Though the biggest change in this stereotype is that as women then were silent and took their place, women now work hard to make something of themselves.</p>
<p>Women have always been seen as the nurse. In the nineteenth century, most doctors were men and most women were nurses. In the picture (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/81916518@N00/431024253/in/photostream/">Nurse</a>), we see that the woman is very happy to be a nurse and is the typical portrayal of a nurse. In the more modern drawing (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/81916518@N00/431024255/in/photostream/">Nurse 2</a>), the little girl is seen playing with her stuffed animal, nurse. This is showing that the stereotype of women being nurturing develops, as women are young children. They are trained to know their role and know that they are meant to be nurses.   In a way, this is stereotypical against men as well. It is saying that men who are nurses are gay and laughed at. For example, in the movie “Meet the parents” the main character is a nurse and is teased for it. As well, this stereotype shows that women are not meant to be doctors and shouldn’t be. The biggest reason that we connect women and nurses is because of the attributes we attribute to women. Women are known to be sweet, tender and caring. As well, they are lovable, sincere and sensitive. All these make women and nurses one. Coincedently that is why we choose to not attribute nurses as being male. Men who are nurses in turn are seen as sensitive and caring, making them look gay and foolish in guyish atmospheres.</p>
<p>            Throughout history women have been stereotyped against. It has been common knowledge that women are meant to be housewives and that only women were meant to be nurses. As a result, many more stereotypes can be formed just from these two alone. Not only can more stereotypes be formed, but also as a culture, we choose to view this group in this sense and think that they cannot be anything else.</p>

					<p>During the 1950’s and 60’s, it was a time where the African-Americans made a mark in history for doing what they believe in which is telling everyone that they are the same as every human being out there. Their encouragement will teach the future that they should be equally treated like the rest of the human population. African-Americans were segregated in almost every aspect including public transportation, public restrooms, and public water fountains. Bus and train transportation did not provide separated vehicles for each race but they did divide the sections of the bus and train according to your race. <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_parks">Rosa</a></strong><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_parks"> Parks</a> refused to give up her seat to a white man and till this day; no one will be where they are right now if it wasn’t for Rosa Parks.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong> <strong>            </strong>Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white man sparked a lot controversy. So severe and outrageous, she was arrested and her case was taken to the court where she was found guilty. With the African-Americans on her side, they boycotted and rallied in the rain which took 382 days. While this was going on, African-American homes and churches were burn. So outrageous, the boycott gained a lot of support around the community and the case of Browder vs. Gayle was file which ended segregation on public buses.         </p>
<p>            What Rosa Parks did was very courageous. Being an African-American during that time was very difficult. Everything that you did was not allowed. It seemed as if someone was watching you trying to catch every move that you did. Rosa Parks believed in herself and didn’t want to be treated differently. Rosa Parks have made a difference in today’s society which allows anyone to do whatever they want to do. With so much freedom, we wouldn’t be doing what we want if it wasn’t for Rosa Parks. Rosa Parks is a wonderful influence on everyone out there that cannot believe in themselves. What Rosa Parks did has earned her recognition around the country. Being brave as it is, it teaches us to stand up for yourself and don’t let the law stop you from doing something that you believe is right.</p>

				<h2><a href="/courses/history120/spring07/the-hurricane.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to The Hurricane">The Hurricane</a></h2>
				<small>March 8th, 2007 <!-- by jcalandr --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>            <strong>The Hurricane tells a deeply moving story of injustice, racism and struggle.</strong> Something all too familiar to many African Americans in the 60’s and 70’s.  Rubin’s ability to mentally overcome his boundaries are truly inspiring and show that anything can be overcome if we put ourselves over those who do us wrong. I say “put ourselves over” because that is exactly what Rubin Carter did, he took his mind and elevated it to a level of understanding and perception, a level of wisdom, that is seldom seen in any individual. He put his mind far out of the reach for any man who wishes to take the one thing he had not lost – his pride.</p>
<p>            When we think of racism, discrimination and corruption in the 60’s and 70’s we often think of the more Southern region of the United States. But for Rubin Carter, a man from New Jersey, racism played an essential role in his life; much of which was spent in and out of prison. The story is told in a dramatic fashion, full of emotion and heart wrenching moments. It comes across as movingly artistic, as if the whole film were an epic story of one man’s struggle. Norman Jewison, the film’s director, made a movie not just built on the basis of entertainment but on awareness, education and maybe most importantly truth. For many people who choose to turn their cheek on the racist aspects of America this film serves as a rude awakening. The depiction of human suffering is something that leaves an impression on people, it opens their eyes to reality, to what really goes on and to what really does happen. Racism and discrimination are not just things we see in textbooks and movies, it is reality and it is often overlooked. </p>
<p>            Most of the movie takes place in the late 60’s through the late 80’s, a period fresh off the wake of the civil rights movement. Rubin’s struggle is just one story of both men and women ripped from their lives because of the color of their skin. His fight for freedom is one consistent with history, injustice after injustice after injustice. In the end, as with many cases similar to Rubin’s, the end is simply another display of fallacies in the American judicial system not yet fixed. The film does a good job of putting deception in the direct spotlight and really putting the facts surrounding the case out to the public’s eye.</p>
<p>            To think of a movie critically it is important to weigh the movies historical accuracy, obviously leaving slack for the purpose of entertainment. Attempting to use a movie for a historical source is a risky business, as things are often left out or exaggerated. In this case, I could not find any incorrect historical events or embellished stories but I still ask myself if its really accurate. This particular event deals with one man and the people who chose to “save” his life, the outcome had no great effect on the American judicial system, it did not change any laws or impact people’s physical lives. It did however impact people’s hearts, everyone from inmates to celebrities. Rather than seeing the movie or the event as a significant historical source I would use Rubin and his life as a source for something in relation to psychology or philosophy. His wisdom and view on life were truly insightful, far beyond the understanding of most individuals and I plan on looking further into his writings and his ideas, Rubin “Hurricane” Carter is without a doubt an inspirational figure.</p>

				<h2><a href="/courses/history120/spring07/tora-tora-tora-vs-pearl-harbor.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Tora! Tora! Tora! vs. Pearl Harbor">Tora! Tora! Tora! vs. Pearl Harbor</a></h2>
				<small>March 8th, 2007 <!-- by brushia --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>As we have seen in class, purely historical representations of events can be boring and unemotional while highly dramatized representations can be overly biased and smudge the truth. <strong>Tora! Tora! Tora! Is a film that proves historical representation can be engaging and eye-opening, while Pearl Harbor is a perfect example of dramatized bias.</strong><br />
Tora!Tora!Tora!(Tora) Was released in 1970 and was nominated for five academy awards, winning in the Best Effects category. This film is unique, because it is essentially two sets of the same story. One English and one Japanese using a different film crew for each. In using two different film crews this film provides a very balanced, and unbiased view of the Pearl Harbor attack and the events that led to it. The intended audience for this film was the American public, in order to educate them about the complexities of what happened regarding the Pearl Harbor attack. This is shown through the various segments in which the Americans are shown overlooking something, and also in the Japanese scenes, showing the internal power struggles within their regime.<br />
Pearl Harbor was released in 2001 and was nominated for four academy awards, winning the Sound Editing category. This film is an intentionally biased account of the events before, during, and after the Pearl Harbor attack. The purpose of this film is for entertainment and to promote a sense of patriotism through the dramatic story of four characters. The intended audience of this film is the stereotypical American moviegoer. This is shown through numerous extraneous fighting sequences which have nothing to do with the Pearl Harbor attack, and also through the complicated love triangle romance which is the main focus of the movie.<br />
There are many stark differences between the interpretation expressed by each film. One such difference was the way in which the United States military was portrayed. In Pearl Harbor, the military was pictured as very intense, and coordinated. On the day of the attack it pictured everyone at their stations in Washington D.C. as ready and intense as ever, when in fact it was on a Sunday, and most of the personnel was off of work at the time. Tora, on the other hand, portrays the military in a much more realistic, human way. The split is shown between the different divisions of the military and is exemplified by the Air Force not being on the list to receive secret information. Tora also shows the concerns of some of the officers about precautions which could have been taken that were just brushed off. For instance, one soldier remarks that putting all of the planes in the center of the field would make an air attack crippling to the fleet. Tora more importantly shows that the United States had many chances to prepare to defend from the Japanese that were just shirked off. For instance, the radar of the planes flying in which were just thought to be American B-17&#8217;s.<br />
An interesting point to be made about Tora is the fact that neither the President of the United States or the Emperor of Japan are shown at all. This shows the true nature of power in the time of World War II, with the president and emperor  not being much more than figureheads. Also in Tora, the president is shown to be taken off of the secret intelligence list temporarily. If the president was a more prominent power, it would be certain that he would be shown in that movie. In Pearl Harbor however, the president is shown numerous times at poignant moments in order to instill a sort of patriotism in the audience, because F.D.R. is a much respected character whom the audience would be familiar with.<br />
Another major difference between the two movies is where they draw the drama from. In Pearl Harbor, four fictional characters are used as personal connections with the audiences, and most of the movie focuses on their stories. The two pilots are characterized as “good ol’ American boys”, the nurse is a strong female character, and the chef on the ship is a proud tough fighter. In addition, three of these characters fall into a love triangle which further dramatizes the film. These characters are used in order for the audience to connect with the movie on a personal level, and to instill further patriotism by showing them in such a positive light. The way Tora accomplishes its drama is usually the pitfall of historical movies making them boring. Tora uses the actual real people who were involved in the incident, and uses their stories to drive the drama of the plot. This is on both the American and Japanese sides. Instead of being boring, this movie uses the real characters to show the implicit complexities surrounding the event. It showed that on both sides there were problems with power balance within their military systems.<br />
One major bias that occurs in Pearl Harbor is that the Japanese are shown as cruel and evil. The first major instance of this is that one of the head of commands of the Japanese forces looks at children playing, and in spite of this is unaffected and says that the Japanese must secretly attack Pearl Harbor. In Tora it is shown though, that the decision to do so came over a very long period of time with much dissent among even the head of the navy. The Emperor also did not want war, but the “hotheads” in the army still pushed their way and got the attack to happen. Pearl Harbor also does not show the Japanese doing anything human. It just shows the Japanese talking about the attack or the Japanese stoically attacking Pearl Harbor. In Tora though, it shows in great detail the human qualities that the Japanese possessed. In Pearl Harbor it shows the Japanese not sending out a second wave of attackers, because of purely cold, logistical reasons, while in Tora it is shown that withdrawing was very much out of mercy.<br />
When looking critically at both movies, Tora!Tora!Tora! Has about 2 hours worth of historical fact while Pearl Harbor has only about twenty and is treated solely as backing material for the main love story. Also, one of the first scenes in Pearl Harbor is supposed to take place on Long Island and there are mountains shown in the background. This discredits the movie from the start, because there are no mountains in Long Island.<br />
If one is looking for a factually based historical movie, but with an engaging, eye-opening aura around it, Tora!Tora!Tora!, should be the movie for you. If you are looking though, for a patriotic romance, with extraneous action built in, then Pearl Harbor is the way to go.</p>

<p>Amistad is a courtroom drama that was considered a controversy since before it ever came on the movie. There were lawsuits that this movie was taken from an even older script, but the lawsuits were later dropped. Everyone knew it was going to be a big hit and everyone wanted a part of it. Directed by Steven Spielberg, it had a considerable amount of recognized actors, including Matthew McConaughey, Anthony Hopkins, and Morgan Freeman. It’s about a rebellion by Africans in 1839 that were headed toward U.S. for slavery. It starts off with an African who releases himself and his group from chains and takes over a ship and slaughtered the white crew. They are then captured and put to trial in Connecticut. There are major Dilemmas about who claimed them and whether or not to free them. <strong>It was a sensitive subject that revolved around many issues including slavery, politics, and the shift of the American society in a very sensitive time between the Declaration of the Independence and the American Civil War in American history.<br />
</strong>Slavery had always been an issue in American history, but never at the level when Amistad took place. The north and south had different views and ideas about many topics and slavery was a major issue. Civil War was about to break out at any moment and no solution had been made. So you can imagine how intense this trial must’ve been with everyone engaged and influencing the outcome and fate of the captured Africans. Throughout the movie they explain to us what happened to them, and how they were dragged out of their homes then taken to this ship where they were tortured and treated horribly (Speilburg seems not to hold anything back with the gruesome images), and now had to deal with the American legal system which now considered them slaves. To represent the Africans abolitionist Theodore Joadson (Morgan Freeman) and a lawyer named Roger Baldwin (Mathew McConaughey). They have trouble at first communicating with Cinque (Djimon Hounsou), the African leader who is frustrated at the whole situation, but as the movie goes on Spielberg does a great job at getting the two lawyers and us, the viewers, to sympathize with Cinque who seemed so unusual at the beginning.</p>
<p>The importance of the case caused politic to play a major role in this situation. Because the outcome of the decision will have a key effect on the outbreak of the civil war top politicians had a voice in the courtroom, such as President Martin Van Buren played by Nigel Hawthorne, and Former President John Quincy Adams played by Anthony Hopkins. President Van Buren wanted to please his allies in the southern states, because re-election was near, and also to try and prevent the idea of a civil war breaking out. So in order to do as planned he had to manipulate the courts arrangements. To try and even things out Joadson went to John Quicy Adams and asked if he could speak at the courtroom, because his support would have a great impact. Adams didn’t want to get in the middle of things so at first he decided not to say anything. After thinking over his thoughts and feeling he decided he had to do the right things. He then went to the supreme court and said, “<em>This man is black. We can all see that. But, can we also see as easily, that which is equally true? That he is the only true hero in this room. Now, if he were white, he wouldn&#8217;t be standing before this court fighting for his life. If he were white and his enslavers were British, he wouldn&#8217;t be standing, so heavy the weight of the medals and honors we would bestow upon him. Songs would be written about him. The great authors of our times would fill books about him. His story would be told and retold in our classrooms. Our children, because we would make sure of it, would know his name as well as they know Patrick Henry&#8217;s. Yet, if the South is right, what are we to do with that embarrassing, annoying document, The Declaration of Independence? What of its conceits? &#8220;All men created equal,&#8221; &#8220;inalienable rights,&#8221; &#8220;life, liberty</em>.&#8221; This quote is what changed the outcome of the case.   </p>
<p>Amistad was a movie that was well written and directed. Each actor played the right part and each had significance to the story. It was entertaining and even though the details aren’t known, through research, I found that the ship carrying slave during the same period had the same story as Amistad. It showed us the transition in the idea of slavery in the American society during pre-Civil War era. It showed us the horror of the slave trade and how it impacted our society. </p>

				<small>March 8th, 2007 <!-- by cpaulson --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>In the movie &#8220;To Kill A Mockingbird,&#8221; there are many issues that are brought up, including the very prominant issue of race and prejudice. The movie takes place in Maycomb, a small town in Southern Alabama in the 1930s. This coming of age tale follows the life of Scout  and Jem Finch, as they grow up in a small southern town during the Depression, amidst clear racism and prejudice against those in different social classes. <strong>In this paper, I intend to show that The Finch family, among other characters in the movie, rise above the current time of racism and the Depression, simply by living out their lives in respectable, positive manner.</strong> Although every character in the movie is faced with these hardships, they come together as a family and also as a community to survive.</p>
<p>Because the movie is set in a small town in Alabama, the mind automatically assumes that everyone there is racist, and that black people are not going to be treated with any respect. This is no the case with the Finch family. Although the father, Atticus Finch, is middle-aged white attorney, he shows clear respect for members of the black community. When Atticus believes that Tom Robinson, a young black male, as been falsey accused of rapping a white woman, he takes the case and becomes Tom&#8217;s lawyer. The fact that they lose the case shows not that Atticus is bad lawyer or did not try his best to win the case, but that the town they live in is still overwhelming racist that all they saw was a black man raping a white woman, Mayelle Ewell, even if they evidence says otherwise. The amoung of people there to support Tom Robinson was overwhelming larger than the group there to support Mayella. Although all of the people there for Tom were shoved high up in what was designated the “colored balcony” you could see the love and support that held strong through their community in times of need. Clearly they knew that Mr. Robinson was being falsely accused of this rape because he was black, not because they had enough actual evidence to actually prove that he had commited a crime. Even Atticus’s children, Jem and Scout, sat in the “colored balcony” to watch the trial.</p>
<p>Although Atticus lost the case, a large portion of his town were simply upset that he took the case to begin with. Bob Ewell, the father of the alleged rape victim, was livid with Atticus for taking the case. He felt betrayed because he truly believed that Tom Robinson did not deserve a good defense because he was black. Even after Atticus lost the case, Bob Ewell attacked Jem and Scout on their way home from a school play one night, almost killing the son, Jem. Boo Radley, a man the children had long been terrified of and had heard many stories about his past, was the one to come to their rescue and save Jem’s life. He proved himself to be a kind, remarkable man, not this picture of evil and insanity the children had always thought him to be.</p>
<p>Physical dangers were not the only threats in the lives of the people of Maycomb, but the threats of the Depression also played a role in threatening their everyday lives. Many people in the town had barely any money and were forced to pay for goods with other goods that they grew or made themselves. The father of a boy the Scout and Jem went to school with, Walter Cunningham, was poor and thought of as white trash. When  his father needed to pay Atticus for some legal work he had done for him, he had no money to pay him, and so he paid Atticus in the only way he could, with a large sack of nuts. Atticus graciously accepted, and thought nothing of it that he was receiving payment not in the form of money, but in food. Because Atticus seemed not to be bothered by this, it was clear that his was a common practice during this time, seeing as people had so little money, they simply paid any way that they could.</p>
<p>I found it very interesting to compare what was considered to be the norm and O.K. then, to what we are used to today. Today, in order for someone to be convicted of a crime, especially such a serious crime as rape, there has to be lots of difinitive evidence, such as DNA evidence, fingerprints, and multiple eye witnesses. That was clearly not the case during the time period of this movie. Today nobody would let you pay them in vegetables or hazelnuts if you did some legal work for them, but then that was the only way a lot of people had to pay, and it was perfectly fine and accepted. The stark contrast between the norms of then and today are very clear, though the idea of compassion and morality is something I hope is still present today, as it was back then.</p>
<p>The Finch family defies every stereotype of a white family in southern Alabama in the 1930s would have. Atticus himself was a kind, caring man who did not see just black and white, and also taught his children to think the same way. Through his actions, he made is clear that not every white man was racist, and also showed that many white people were prejudice against the black community for no good reason at all. The lessons he taught his children, and the lessons his children learned not only from him, but form his community, shaped them into the wonderful people we would want them to be. Though it was clear that living in the south during the Depression and amidst such strong racism was not an easy thing, the Finch family rises above it to show that not everyone must be defeated by such negative thoughts, and equality and peace of mind were not that far away.</p>

					<p>The American Civil War was one of the most significant events that have happened in American history. Many films have been made to portray the Civil War battles and lifestyles. However, the movie that sticks in my head on the topic of the Civil War is <u>Glory</u>. This movie is a very historical movie that depicts the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Regiment during the American Civil War. <strong><u>Glory</u> shows the unfair treatment of African Americans in the </strong><strong>U.S.</strong><strong> Army while fighting in the Civil War through the depiction of Col</strong><strong>. Robert Gould Shaw’s 54<sup>th</sup> regiment<strong>.</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>            </strong><strong>This movie shows us how the U.S. Army during the Civil War unfairly treated the African American soldiers and their struggle against their mistreatment. The film focuses on one of the first formal all African American units, the 54<sup>th</sup> Massachusetts Volunteer Regiment. The first evident injustice to the African American soldiers was that they were all placed in the same unit. During the Civil War the units that did allow African Americans had to be segregated from the white units. This made these soldiers feel as though they were not part of the “team” for example and looked down upon. Moreover, these African American units had to be commanded by all white officers. These officers were mostly abolitionists and did not mistreat the soldiers; however, the fact that these soldiers could not command themselves and needed a white officer to command them. This is a very historical fact that did happen at this time. Even though the fight for abolition was one of the main causes of the war and the African Americans wanted to join the fight having considerable motivation, they were not all allowed to serve and only a few African American units were created. Most of the African Americans in the units were depicted as runaway slaves from the South; however this was not the case. The majority of the soldiers were born free in the North. This is one fact that was misrepresented in the film. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>            This film really portrays the effort set forth by the African American soldiers during the American Civil War despite the unreasonable circumstances the U.S. Army put the soldiers through. In one scene of the movie the colored soldiers refuse pay for their duties simply because it was unequal of those that were white. This unequal treatment caused a great discouraging effect but shows their persistence when they want to fight so desperately for their country despite this injustice.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>            In all the movie had some historical imperfections but was mostly historical accurate. The African American units were never really given a chance to prove themselves in battle. These units were looked down upon the white units because they felt that they were better trained and that the colored units were simply incapable of leading a major attack. In the end, the 54<sup>th</sup> </strong><strong>Massachusetts</strong><strong> gets to prove themselves in battle fighting together with their white comrades in the attack of </strong><strong>Fort</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Wagner</strong><strong>.  In the last scenes of the film the 54<sup>th</sup> leads the famous attack on the south at </strong><strong>Fort</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Wagner</strong><strong>. The regiment loses about half of their men in the fight. Yet records show that the regiment only suffered about one-fifth to fatalities. The attack was the first to be led by an African American unit and proved to the U.S. Army that they were capable of being men and fighting remarkably. Many of the African American soldiers that survived received the Medal of Honor for their notable attack on </strong><strong>Fort</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Wagner</strong><strong>. In the last part of the film Col. Shaw was seen being shot and killed right after commanding his troops to move forward against the Confederates, which was based on actual accounts of this battle.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>In the final scene the colonel gets buried with the rest of his troops, which is also accurately depicted. This portrayal was meant, at the time of the war, to be an insult but shows the unity within the unit that existed due to the unfair treatment of the African American units by the U.S. Army. This movie truly illustrates the many different conflicts of prejudice within the U.S. Army that continued throughout the Civil War conflict. <u>Glory</u> was one of the best historical films because it takes a topic rarely discussed when discussing the American Civil War and shows how the war was really like in the eyes of an African American soldier in the U.S. Army. This movie is a must see for any true historian.</strong></p>

					<p>Violent. Chaotic. Overwhelming. After viewing <em>Saving Private Ryan</em>, these are the three words that immediately come to mind. Yet despite the scenes of war and death, by the end of the movie the viewer is left feeling a sense of hope. A group of soldiers are sent on the task of bringing back one man to the United States, who has unknowingly lost his three brothers already, while incurring many obstacles in their search for this soldier. <em>Saving Private Ryan</em> most easily recognized theme is strewn throughout the movie; when is one life more important than another? <strong>Steven Spielberg&#8217;s critically acclaimed movie, <em>Saving Private Ryan</em>, provides a look into the sorrows, triumphs, and senselessness death of World War II through the eyes of one infantry on the search for one man.</strong></p>
<p>In the opening of the movie, anyone who is curious as to how violent this film will be is quickly thrown into, in my opinion, the most violent part of the entire film. D-day. This is shown through the eyes of soldiers storming the beaches of Normandy. These scenes continue for a long, gruesome thirty minutes complete with shots of limbs being blown off, bullets cutting threw the bodies of many men, entrails being spewn onto others, and the look of fear in the eyes of many of these men, who have probably never seen battle, let alone so much death around them. Spielberg uses these opening scenes not only to evoke a feeling of sadness and loss, but also to make people understand that the way these men died was horrible and senseless.</p>
<p>Although the film, especially the opening scenes at D-day, hope to make the viewer understand the death and destruction as horrible and overall pointless, the main goal is not to say that the role of the United States in WWII was not needed or important. On the contrary, I believe the main point of the movie is to depict the overall senselessness in war itself. In a movie review about <em>Saving Private Ryan, </em>James Berardinelli states,&#8221;<em>Saving Private Ryan</em> quickly  and brutally dispels the notion that war is anything but vicious, demoralizing violence that makes a  cruel joke out of the human body and spirit.&#8221; While the U.S. was needed and, I believe, made the right decision in joining the side of the Allies, it is the immense loss of life that could have been prevented had the disagreements and issues never been allowed to escalate to the point of an all-out war in Europe. <em>Saving Private Ryan</em> takes this idea and puts it into a story of what some would call heroic, some would call ridiculous, idea to save one man.</p>
<p>Another scene which really hits home with the unfair loss of life is a scene in which the group, led by Tom Hanks&#8217; character, is walking through a field, continuing their journey to find Private Ryan. Unfortunately, the come upon a group of German men, presumably left to guard this particular area, and are immediately drawn into battle. After a few minutes of fighting, the U.S. soldiers are successful, but not without the loss of one of their men. In this scene is the main controversy between the remaining six men of the group about what exactly it is they are doing and if it is even important. It is here the viewers cannot help but be torn themselves. Why should this man have to die, and consequently many of the others, just to potentially save another? This is also the first time in the movie the viewer really begins to feel for the characters. Tom Hanks&#8217; character is a school teacher normally, with a wife and children, and many of the other characters share their lives and family stories throughout the movie and as a human, you cannot help but feel extreme sorrow when they are killed one after another.</p>
<p>Finally, after what feels like an eternity, the group finds Private Ryan. Adding insult to injury, Ryan, played by Matt Damon, refuses to leave. He speaks about the duty he has to his fellow soldiers and the duty he has to himself. Also a very powerful quote in the movie, he states, &#8220;Tell my mother I stayed here with the only brothers I have left.&#8221; Here the viewer cannot help but admire and, at the same time, just simply be angry with him. One of the soldiers displays this emotion by angrily telling off Ryan, explaining those who have died to get to him and all the sacrifices they have made to reach this point. This scene brings about emotions and the conflict that is war. Spielberg purposely wants this to happen so the viewer can feel the conflict and confusion these soldiers felt. While they have essentially completed their task and can finally breathe a sigh of relief, the men are thrown another curve ball and must deal with yet another problem.</p>
<p>While Spielberg uses emotion as a main way to bring about his theme in the movie, there are also many aspects which really give it credibility as well. For instance, the weaponry used throughout the movie is very accurate to what would have been used in the real combat. Also, the shooting was done very well. In the D-Day invasion at the beginning of the movie, they shot a lot of shots with hand held cameras. Berardinelli also makes points about some of the cinematography when he states they used, &#8220;hand-held cameras, a slight  speeding up of the images, muted colors, and several different kinds of film stock.&#8221; All these factors helped to create the realistic scenes in the movie and left the viewers feeling like they could have actually been there.</p>
<p>In the end, Ryan does in fact make it out alive, but not without the cost of many men, among them Tom Hanks character. The viewer is left wondering whether or not it is all worth it.<br />
Overall, Steven Spielberg does a great job capturing the hearts of the audience throughout the movie in many different scenes. As a human being, you cannot help but feel for these characters as they struggle to complete a mission that has proven itself impossible. The question, who is more important, is never really answered and is left up for the viewer to decide. The one thing you are left with at the conclusion however, is a strong sense of remorse that these men died, that so many men died, in something that could have been prevented. War, whether seemingly necessary or not at the time, is not the &#8220;right&#8221; answer and the deaths of so many prove this in <em>Saving Private Ryan</em>.</p>

				<small>March 8th, 2007 <!-- by nkelly4 --></small>

					<p>&#8220;Glory&#8221; directed by Edward Zwick captures the reality of the Civil War with an amazing cast including Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, and Morgan Freeman. Glory is about the 54th Massachusetts regiment which was the first all black regiment to serve in the Civil War. Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) led the regiment and had the challenging task of preparing these untrained voluntary soldiers for war. Shaw also had to put up with criticism from other ranking officials and the impartial attitudes towards the 54th regiment. The 54th regiment was treated unfairly by receiving lower wages and not receiving proper supplies. However, Colonel Shaw and his other ranking officials made a huge statement when they too ripped up their paychecks after the black soldiers did so in defiance of being paid less than white soldiers. The black soldiers argued that we die just like anyone else, and when the officers decided to rip their checks they got respect and loyalty from their soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>The movie&#8217;s overall message is about the hardships that black soldiers faced in fighting in the Civil War, and the impact that black people had on the Civil War</strong>. The black people fighting for the &#8220;54&#8243; wanted to be treated as equal human beings and went to great lengths to prove it by dying for that right. The &#8220;54&#8243; also wanted to prove that they were in fact not only capable of fighting in a war but could do it just as well if not better than any other regiment. It showed the courage of black people in a time when slavery was still present. The 54th regiment had no respect from other soldiers at the beginning and really had to earn their respect by fighting and dying for their country like the rest of the soldiers. By the end of the movie it was clear that the 54th regiment was a strong infantry and respect was rightfully given to them. One scene in particular that exemplified this was when one of the soldiers from another unit who had previously degraded the &#8220;54&#8243; stood as the &#8220;54&#8243; passed preparing to attack a Confederate Fort in Charleston, S.C. and yelled &#8220;Give em hell 54&#8243; in a way that said we respect you (one of my favorite parts). Everyone knew the daunting task of attacking the Fort yet no one in the &#8220;54&#8243; showed any signs of fear. This movie is a great use of history in teaching people the impact that black people actually had on the Civil War, and surprisingly many people didn&#8217;t realize that black people fought and died in this war, and in every war that America has fought for our freedoms.</p>
<p>The movie was designed to be very dramatic and powerful so it&#8217;s easy to see that some of the scenes were exaggerated a little bit to increase the drama of the movie. For instance, it was stated that the black units never had to go months without proper boots and uniforms. I also question whether or not they were paid unequally in comparison to white union soldiers, although I could believe this to be true. In this period of time blacks in the union, although freed slaves were still treated unequally in comparison to white soldiers which was accurately stated in the movie. I wondered how the other all-white regiments actually felt about having a black regiment fighting on their side, it seems to me that they would be grateful for the help and very appreciative, but in the beginning of the movie this was not the case and most people took the &#8220;54&#8243; as a joke that would never actually engage in real battles.</p>
<p>The musical background of the movie done by composer James Horner is absolutely beautiful. The musical theme is played throughout the movie and had such an emotional impact on me when watching it. The music is just as powerful as the screenplay and is definitely a key ingredient in making Glory so profound. This in my mind is one of the most poignant musical themes in any movie I&#8217;ve ever seen</p>

					<p align="center">Hotel Rwanda-The Mass Genocide</p>
<p>                Imagine if our country went through the equivalent of 266 World Trade Center bombings in 100 days. Also imagine, instead of terrorists perpetrating these acts, it was a militia comprised of neighbors, family, and friends. In 1994, a war began when Hutu extremists waged war on the minority Tutsis initiating a terrible campaign of genocide that killed over 800,000 people and displaced and entire nation. “Hotel Rwanda”, a film by Terry George, is the true story of the four star Les Milles Collines Hotel in Kigali, Rwanda during a time of turmoil. As the world ignored the people of Rwanda, this hotel gave refuge to over 1,000 people seeking safety in the center of a civil war. <strong><u>Hotel Rwanda</u> gives life to the 1994 mass genocide by telling the terrible story of Rwanda through one man and his struggle to keep his family alive.<br />
</strong><strong>            </strong>In Rwanda, over 800,000 were slaughtered as the Tutsi and Hutu tribes struggled over control of the country. Encouraged by bigotry, racist Hutu radio and the assassination of the country’s president, Juvenal Habyarimana, the Hutu started annihilating the Tutsis as mob rule prevailed. But unlike so many cases of genocide, where there are clear religious or racial differences, the Tutsi and Hutu are nearly identical, only differentiated by the previous colonial government, which taught one group to hate the other.  As friends attacked friends, neighbors kill neighbors and children become the target for the Hutu who seek to kill the next generation of the Tutsi, Paul Rusesabagina  realizes that his home, as he knew it, was gone forever. Rusesabagina is the manager of an elite resort in Rwanda, where the tourists come for vacation, and where the country’s elites come for a free drink and good conversation. Once the slaughter starts, his hotel quickly becomes an island in a sea of destruction. Within days, United Nations peacekeepers have set up camp outside his front door, hundreds of desperate Tutsis rush to him looking for shelter and safety, and he soon finds his family, as well as 1,200 Rwandans under his care as they hide from the hell that exists only miles away. <u>Hotel Rwanda</u> is really the story of this struggle as seen through Rusesabagina’s eyes.<br />
                <u>Hotel Rwanda</u>  is meant to touch the people that were sheltered from this story. Much of the media in the western world ignored Rwanda’s cry for help as hundreds of thousands were being massacred. The governments and the United Nations ignored cries for help from Rwandans they called friends.  In the movie, Colonel Oliver, a UN official, talked to Paul Rusesabagina and shed light to how he thought the western world felt about Rwanda. <br />
                You’re dirt, we think your dirt.<br />
                Who is we.<br />
                The west, all the super powers, everything you believe in Paul, they think your dirt. They think your dung. You’re worthless.<br />
                I’m afraid I do not understand what you are saying sir.<br />
                Come on, don’t bullshit me Paul. You’re the smartest man here. You got them all eating out of your hands. You could own this freaking hotel except for one thing, you’re black. You’re not even a nigger. You’re an African.<br />
                This quote struck a nerve in me that I believe affected the entire audience. When the tragedy in Rwanda occurred I was only 9 years old. As I recall, I do not remember hearing about the crisis in Rwanda or anything about it as the years have gone on.  I may have been sheltered from it but as far as the audience goes, I believe we were all highly disengaged in the happenings of Rwanda.  This tragedy was not decades ago, it was in the age of high speed communication. Any country would have been suitable to go in and protect the civilians against the renegade, yet no one stepped up.  <br />
                Paul Rusesbagina’s story was told to bring a heroic storyline to a gruesome genocide. His version is meant to tell the whole country’s account beyond the facts and figures that we could see on the news. He brought life to what occurred in Rwanda, with few things changed in the movie.  Rusesbagina’s courage to keep his family alive was just one illustration of the many different stories and accounts that people reported after the war. Not intervening in the war was a bad and forgotten move by the entire world. Hotel Rwanda gives light to a story forgotten or unheard of by many, and lived by many more.</p>

					<p>Jaw-dropping, uplifting, intense, a tear-jerker. This movie was spectacular. It is not “old history,” yet, but to our generation it is a real life experience. We all talk about it and can share our stories from that day. I remember it very clearly. I was a freshman in high school and was sitting in religion class when Mr. Hamer came in and whispered something to my teacher. She turned on the television and we all just starred. I was confused, just like the people in the movie were. I thought that the plane had just lost control and it was merely an accident. When the police officers in the movie saw it on their television, they thought the same thing. They said things like maybe the pilot “…ran out of gas” or it was a small plane and the man did not know how to operate his craft. September 11, 2001 was a very chaotic day. <strong>“World Trade Center” was created to show us a personal encounter of what such an evil act can commit, what human beings are capable of and to bring out the goodness of people.</strong><br />
The movie “World Trade Center” is a story based on the lives of two actual survivors, John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno, New York City Port Authority Policemen, and what their families went through. The movie gets to the point right away, within ten minutes the first plane struck the building. However, they did not show the plane actually hit, all that was pictured was the shadow of a plane very close to the ground and a policeman looking up at it. Perhaps this was because the sight of the plane striking the building is too much for certain people who were personally affected by the incident to see it happen. Or it just leads for you to picture it yourself. In a way it is more mysterious not to see it, because one just knows how horrible it really was. There were many graphic images throughout the movie too. For example, when all the citizens were watching the towers burn, you see a lady jump from one of the buildings and fall screaming. It may not be graphic to the point of blood and gore, but emotionally graphic.<br />
The movie was shot through the eyes of the police officers. Everything was so chaotic that even they did not know what was going on. Sergeant McLoughlin was not even aware that a second plane had struck tower two. He was getting his team ready to go up into the first tower when it came crashing down on them. Only three from the fourteen survived the disastrous collapse and eventually one died after having a chunk of the tower crush his lower half, leaving only McLoughlin and Jimeno. The two men were trapped under rubble and smashed from the waist down. There was no way for them to get out from under the heavy slabs of concrete.<br />
Jimeno has a four year old daughter and a pregnant wife, while McLoughlin has four children at home and a wife. What kept these men alive are the thoughts of home and the love they have for their families. The emotion of the families and wives especially was very intense. It had you cheering the men on to live and to not give up. Having the movie focus on the lives of these two men make the event more “heavy.” Instead of just thinking that thousands of lives were lost, you get to see the emotional strain and feelings, concerns, and fears of the men trapped as well as their families. It makes you feel it more and relate to it, could that happen to my husband? The director, Oliver Stone, chose to shoot it this way, instead of just showing a broad view of a general person’s perspective so that you can see how this evil act could tear a family apart. Jimeno’s wife, Allison, asked her father, “How do I tell Bianca her father is dead?”<br />
Anyone can relate to this and think of their father, mother, children, and it pulls at your heart. The intended audience for this film is everyone. This act affected the world. It changed the way people act towards each other, and it changed the way we go about our daily lives. Who doesn’t think a terrifying thought when they first get on the metro? Or see a plane close to the ground? The events that happened on September 11, 2001 will never be forgotten. They taught us a new and better way to live. We need to help one another. In the film, a retired Marine found his sense of patriotism again and left his life behind to go find survivors. He was out there with one other man after all the others had gone home for the night searching for people. He found the two men. If it wasn’t for him they would have died. He knew his calling was to help people and he put them first. He told them, “You are my mission.” John McLoughlin said it best at the end, “Nine Eleven showed us what human beings are capable of…It also brought out the goodness we forgot could exist. People taking care of each other for no other reason that it was the right thing to do…It is important for us to remember.”<br />
Historical facts provided from the movie are seen at the end. Some powerful facts include: 2,749 people died at the World Trade Center, including people from 87 different countries, only twenty people were pulled out alive; Will Jimeno and John McLoughlin were numbers eighteen and nineteen.</p>

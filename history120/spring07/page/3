				<small>May 7th, 2007 <!-- by mryanb --></small>

					<p>Freemasonry is something that has been around for many centuries. It has been around from the early Egyptian times, to the Knights of Templar, to the Founding Fathers or our country, and still today by many people. Freemason teaching is associated with geometric figures and shapes, symbols and signs, astrology, and great empires from the Egyptian and Greco-Roman times. Many of the founding fathers, from George Washington to Benjamin Franklin who helped make up our government and build of capital were Masons. <strong>Our founding fathers free mason belief led to the way our nations capital was built and the way we see it today.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>            </strong><a href="http://www.earthstation1.com/EsotericaFiles/Pics/Masonic/TN_Square&amp;Compass.jpg">    The Masonic square and compass</a> is something that you can find in the layout of Washington D.C. A lot of people will tell you that it is just a coincidence, but it is to much of a coincidence to be overlooked and the facts that support it are to hard to overlook too. The Masonic square and compass is the main symbol that is used in mason teachings today. You can find the Masonic square and compass by taking the capitol building, the white house, Lincoln memorial, and the Thomas Jefferson memorial. In this <a href="http://maps.mapnetwork.com/dc/wctc/index.asp">map</a> if you draw outlines starting at the capitol building to the White House and use Pennsylvania avenue for the left leg and the white house for the left leg to stand on then use Maryland avenue as the right leg and the Jefferson memorial for the right leg to stand on for the leg on you will see the outline of the Masonic square and compass. I chose to write about this because it is one of the main symbols that can be seen in the layout of Washington with reference to Mason beliefs. The most interesting part of all of this is the Jefferson memorial. It sits off to the right and away from most of the main part of Washington D.C. Out of all the places to build a monument it was built where it is. The Jefferson memorial is one of the newer monuments in D.C. It was proposed by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1934. What makes this interesting is that Roosevelt was a mason. So even though this could all be a coincidence it really is too much of a coincidence that the person who suggested this was a mason and it completes the design of the Masonic square and compass. So as much as expects and historians want to dispose of this, its hard to overlook because there are so many facts to support it.</p>
<p>The Federal Triangle which can be seen with the map provided in the above paragraph is made up of Pennsylvania Avenue, Constitution avenue, and 15<sup>th</sup> street. It can be extended to include the White House, Washington monument, and the Capitol building and that is what I am going to talk about. Like I mentioned in my opening paragraph, astrology is a big part of mason belief. The Founding Fathers decided to incorporate the astrological views into our Nations Capital. There are three fixed stars that lie over and align perfectly with the White House, Washington monument, and the Capitol on certain dates. The stars are Arcturus, Regulus, and Spica. It is suggested that fixed stars represent stability and spiritual benevolence, traits that are desirable when constructing a new powerful institutional government. The other thing that makes this pattern all point towards mason teaching is that the constellation Virgo lies in the triangle that the three stars make. Virgo is the astrological sign of Masonry. The sign of Virgo is incorporated everyone in our Nations Capital. From being in buildings to being in the layout of the sky, Virgo has a very strong influence in Washington.</p>
<p>The last aspect I am going to look at in terms of Mason beliefs and Washington D.C. is the architectural design of some of the buildings and monuments. Like I said earlier Mason teachings are associated with Greco-Roman times. If you look at a lot of the buildings and monuments in Washington what do they remind you of? They would remind you of Roman architecture. The Washington monument, in terms of Mason beliefs is a large column. It is one of the largest masonry built things today. Like the roman columns this is one single column standing tall. The one column stands for him being the one, the one that got American started, and the height of it being the like him looking out upon what he started like a father. This is how he was suppose to be remembered. He was the first mason president, he was the father of our country. So the that is what the column represents in mason beliefs. The Jefferson memorial is another one that I am going to look at. Going back to relating these monuments with Roman times the Jefferson memorial looks very similar to the <a title="Pantheon of Rome" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon_of_Rome">Pantheon of Rome</a>. Even though there is no proof that Jefferson was a mason and no proof that he was not, he did heavily support mason teachings and he did have a very strong interest in Roman architecture. So maybe because he liked the Roman architecture so much they constructed his memorial the way they did, but maybe the memorial was suppose to go along with the design of the city and the Mason beliefs that were incorporated already to the city.</p>
<p>It can not just be a coincidence, when Washington was built our founding fathers wanted to make sure that their beliefs would be incorporated into the nation that they were going to form. Even though some of this stuff is just little things and you have to research it to find it, it is still significant towards us knowing what our nation was built upon and the beliefs that is was too. Free Mason teachings is something that not many people fully know about and unless you are a mason you will not know everything that they know. The things we do know are things that support everything that I have said. Free Mason teachings is something our country was built upon, for us to remember what our founding fathers believed and how they wanted our country to be. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79264857@N00/sets/">Flickr</a> photos</p>

					<p>Since it&#8217;s debut in 1999, South Park has been a hotbed of controversy over its language and subject matter. As a loyal viewer, I have noticed growth in the shows ability to tackle subject matter with humor and almost irony. For examply, in one epsiode, the boys go through the &#8220;Hall Of Stereotypes&#8221; There, they see a covetous Jew, an Asian with a calculator, and a sleepy mexican, who was actually just the janitor. SOme shows could never get away with something like that, but Ill tell you why South Park can. By being so incredibly discriminatory, the show does not discriminate. The show has managed to insult every mass group, religion, and race in the modern world. And by doing that, South Park has never failed to shock the world. But no group is left untouched, which is why they should be considered fair. South Park will insult republicans and democrats. Blacks and whites. How many times have you laughed at a joke made about your own kind? It&#8217;s because you know that they are simply going to offend somebody else, and you wont get offended. The ones who get too offended are the ones who are too sensitive. Don&#8217;t be too sensitive America.</p>

					<p>Since early civilizations, the circle was believed to be a symbol that represented a binding force.  Ultimately, it became a symbol for perfection, the unity of self, and the heart of humanity.  In my opinion, the circle represents consistency, a never-ending cycle, but most importantly harmony.  The peace symbol shows significance of a circular shape because it stands for tranquility.  Thus, I feel circles represent a tight bond that keeps ties together.  <strong>My particular impression of the National Mall illustrates how history symbolizes a theme of unity through the use of exquisite details arranged in a circular form.</strong></p>
<p>The Lincoln Memorial symbolizes unity because a huge sculpture of Lincoln sits on a high chair that is placed in the center overlooking everyone.  I chose the Lincoln Memorial because he led our country to independence and was courageous to speak his mind despite what others thought.  The Lincoln sculpture is placed in the center of the memorial so that tourists can gather around it and rejoice together for his strong leadership.  When I walked into the memorial, I saw everyone circling around together embracing Lincoln’s sculpture which made me feel a sense of unity.  There were also columns that surrounded the Lincoln sculpture and above them were 36 states that were in union at the time of Lincoln’s death.  This shows that the Lincoln Memorial was built with much detail, paying close attention to the significance of numbers.   To further signify the circle, there was also a painting of the north and south unity on the north wall.</p>
<p>The World War II Memorial was designed in a circular shape using pillars as a tribute to our nation.  The pillars were made with exquisite detail because it was built for the 56 states and territories that fought during the WWII generation.  In the middle of this memorial, there are also semicircular waterfalls and fountains that gravitates people to it and gathers everyone together.  Each pillar also had a wreath adorned with oak and wheat to commemorate the nations that fought during the war.  The wreaths are placed to honor the victory of the WWII generation.  A circular pathway was engulfed around the pillars so that tourists could be more engaged to the site and show their gratitude and appreciation.</p>
<p>The George Washington Monument pays particular attention to detail using 50 flagpoles that symbolizes each state in the Union.  Each state&#8217;s flag encircles the perimeter of the monument, creating a circular shape that signifies unity.  I chose the George Washington Monument because he, just like Lincoln, led our country to independence.  Perhaps that is why this is the tallest building that overlooks the District of Columbia.  This monument is roughly 555’ high and can be seen standing from any angle or distance at the National Mall.  The height shows the prominence of our first president.  The pyramid shaped Egyptian obelisk points to the sky which gave me a sense of freedom.  The height of this monument definitely symbolizes unity because everyone can look at the monument without having to stand at a particular place.  Knowing that many other people were looking at the building at the same time made me feel a sense of togetherness and warmth.  Since the George Washington Monument stands so high, it gives people an opportunity to embrace it in unison.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Lincoln Memorial, World War II Memorial, and the George Washington Monument symbolize unity because they are all constructed in circular forms.  Even though the Lincoln Memorial was not exactly designed in a circular shape, it was made so that tourists could gather in a circle around the Lincoln sculpture.  Thus, these memorials were designed so that people could reflect and acknowledge our prominent leaders in America and the people who sacrificed their lives during the war.  The designers paid much attention to the use of details that further helped us to honor our history, and acknowledge our heroic people.  All the numbers used in the sites had a valuable reason for its significance.  Furthermore, the circles are a portrayal of unity which brings people together to reminisce about our past, and the exquisite details enable us to pay particular attention to our history.</p>

					<p>The National Mall is home to much more than just the standard postcard sites of The Washington Monument and The Lincoln Memorial. There are many smaller monuments hidden among the trees that no one sees because they aren&#8217;t as advertised or well known. <strong>Many people really don&#8217;t care about what Memorials stand for.</strong> This can be shown through either lack of interest or, in rare cases, outright disrespect. Although, I can only imagine that disrespect is limited to immature youth and that adults would have the sense not to do such things.</p>
<p>I start with a look at the World War II and Lincoln Memorials to show how many people come out to see the big memorials, even on days of poor weather. (Both days I went, the weather was either cold or rainy) I show various reasons why people visit. In the case of the World War II Memorial, many veterans came that day to pay their respects.</p>
<p>The next memorial I show is the Korean War Memorial. Here, I continue to show why people come to see the memorials, but I also show some minor bits of disrespect towards the memorial. One such disrespect is the practice of throwing coins in the fountain, but I will chalk that up to ignorance as opposed to disrespect.</p>
<p>The World War I Memorial is shown next, with nearly no people around. The lack of care and renovation is apparent with stained marble and grass sprouting between the cracks of the walkway.</p>
<p>I combined the many pieces of work around the Vietnam Memorial as part of the memorial as they all deal with aspects of the Vietnam War. Some pieces are well known and are the subject of many pictures, and memorials of individual people. Others however are seen rarely, or glossed over as &#8220;What is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>The final site is the Memorial of the 56 Signers of the US Declaration of Independence. There were more birds than people here when I visited. And at one point, two people showed up and picked a flower. They said something along the lines of &#8220;There&#8217;s no entry here,&#8221; though I&#8217;m not really sure what that person was saying. I don&#8217;t even think they knew where they were.</p>
<p>Anyway, pictures speak louder than words, so <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/89546203@N00/sets/72157600183865422/">have a look.<br />

<p>The National Mall houses some of the most important and influential people and events throughout all of the American history. Millions travel there each year and can expect to see monuments from George Washington to memorials for events such as the Vietnam War. As many go to visit these attractions, none of them ever stop to think why the statues are placed in that specific way. Though when all things are considered, there is significance to every aspect of the statue right down to the reason the feet are spaced out the way they are. <strong>On the National Mall, our perceptions of historical figures can be seen through just looking at the body, positioning and facial expressions of the statues themselves.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Through an in-depth look at the statue of Abraham Lincoln, a tourist can learn information even if they did not know who he was or what he did. For example, by just looking at Lincoln’s feet you can infer a lot about him. The positions of his feet give you a look into the two sides of Lincoln. One of his feet is placed so that it is coming off of the platform of the chair, so that it appears to be dangling off. Through this we can see that people, at least the sculptor, saw that Lincoln faced problems head on and that he was always ready to “spring into action.” While the other foot is seen to be rather stiff and parallel to the back of the chair. This helps to show his stubbornness and inflexibility. At the same time, you are able to see clear-cut spacing between his two legs and feet. This helps to show that we see him as a person who doesn’t like to mix his two personalities; that you cannot get two comfortable with his eagerness or with his firmness. It shows that he is a changing man that is unpredictable. Lastly, through the clenching of his hand, we are able to also infer something. His hand shows his need for power and control. It allows people to see that Lincoln was always in command and got things done how and when he wanted to.</p>
<p>By taking a look at Franklin D. Roosevelt’s statue we are also able to get a look into whom he was as a leader and as a person. The fact that he has all his body weight shifted to one side of the chair shows us a look into his readiness and eagerness to fight the hardships and make a difference. As well though, there is a clear distinction between his body. On one side, we are able to see his leg and his two arms. Though on the other side, everything has been hidden by his cape. The positioning of the cape to hide half of his body gives us insight into our perception of Roosevelt. Through this we can see that the people felt that he was trying to hide something. It is as if there was something that he didn’t want anybody to know. This could either be related to his illness, or his methods in fighting the depression. Lastly, the positions of his arms, one on top of the other resting on the arm chair, shows us that he was a very relaxed leader that took events calmly and resolved them with concentration and understanding.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson’s statue is unlike many of the other statues on the mall. Most of the statues depict a man who is sitting down, while his statue is standing straight up. As well, his statue is rather large with him looking extremely tall. The fact that he is standing and the largeness of the statue gives the tourist a sense of just how significant he was and how significant we think he is. It makes it a point to portray him so tall to that you “look up” to him. This allows people to see that his achievements and accomplishments were ones that are hard to emulate. It gives us a sense that Jefferson was “larger than life.” This could be a result of the fact that we hold very sacred the Declaration of Independence and view the writer a very important man. Like Lincoln, Jefferson can be seen with one hand formed into a clenched fist. Again, this shows his power and need to be in control and in charge. Lastly, Jefferson can be seen with his leg bent and one of his feet placed a little farther out. This again shows his willingness and ability to take action when necessary. It also lets people know that he has a softer side. That he is not “all work and no play.” It gives a sense that there is a side of Jefferson that is more relaxed and capable of being unstressed.</p>
<p>Lastly, when you look at George Mason’s statue on the Mall, you are able to learn about things you may have otherwise not known. For example, Mason is positioned so that he is relaxing and kind of leaning to one side. This helps show how his importance is somewhat limited. Unlike the other statues, such as Lincoln or Jefferson who are seen very stiff and unmoved, Mason is more leaned back. This may be because he was not a president and is not as significant as the others in our eyes. In one of his hands though he is holding a book open with his fingers. This shows his intelligence and knowledge. We are able to see just how important, mentally, that Mason was to the growth of America. To also re-enforce his intelligence Mason’s face looks as if he is starring into space pondering his next big idea.</p>
<p>Mason, Jefferson, Roosevelt and Lincoln, what do they all have in common? Each can be found sitting or standing on the National Mall in D.C. Upon first glance, most people would notice things such as the books next to Mason or the dog next to Roosevelt. Though when you really look at the facial expressions of the statues or the way the body and its parts are positioned you are able to learn so much about the person. The four statues of the four men all have one thing in common: they are all perceived by people to be intelligent, powerful and unforgettable.<br />

					<p>Over the past few years, the controversial topic of the confederate flag has become more and more prevalent. For some the symbol represents southern pride, heritage of the confederacy along with many other positive notions. For others the flag is a symbol of hate and opression. In a country where the citizens are from a multitude of nationalities and backgrounds, your going to come to some point in time where two people disagree. <strong>The flying of the confederate flag should be a states right to choose rather than being controlled by the government. </strong></p>
<p>In this article <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/11/01/elec04.prez.dean.confederate.flag/">here,</a> Howard Dean struck high controversey by stating that he wants the support of those that drive pickup trucks and rock the ol&#8217; stars and bars. While this attempt to rally support from southern crowd earned him a standing ovation from supporters, other Democratic canidates were irrate and disgusted. Dean, who has made these types of statements on more than one occasion, believed that this statement would sway the southerners who have been voting republican, to change their mind and support Dean.</p>
<p>A more recent <a href="http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=19494">article,</a> entais Hillary Clintion stating that the south, may be just a little too southern. According to Hillary, it is apparently Un-American to be southern and take pride in a flag which your fore fathers flew as they went in to battle. These days children are being expelled from their schools for wearing shirts that carry the symbol so proudly and it affects no only the children that were ousted, but those that view the flag as hateful.</p>
<p>In a society where freedom and rights are glorified, its funny that we are trying to control people still. The flying of a historical flag, should be someones own personal choice, not necessairly the states. If a state would like to fly the flag above their capital then it should be up to their citizens to choose. This would be the &#8220;democratic&#8221; way to approach the situation. Yet we let symbolism take charge of our opinions and in turn we would all like to everyone else to agree with the way we percieve things. WAKE UP! Thats not how life works, and if it was, I&#8217;d be a millionaire that practices polygamy</p>
<p>While it is belived that we should stand united under one flag, which we do in most cases with the American Flag, who are we to say what an individual can and cannot display. The symbol of the Confederate flag will always hold certain value to some, while it may be viewed in a completely different light by others. It really comes down to a matter of personal opinion, and who are we to tell someone else what to think and how to act. Sounds a little like we are trying to play a game of who wants to be a communist.</p>

					<p>The confederate states of American were the government formed by southern states of the united states of American during the civil war. There were eleven southern states used flag which it made by southern states, and the confederate flag used during its existence form 1861 to 1865. The confederate flag is still a widely recognized symbol, to people in the southern United States who were support the confederate flag; it is a symbol of their heritage and pride. To northern states confederate flag see it as a symbol of the institution of slavery and racial segregation. <strong>After civil war, the </strong><strong>confederate flag is still big historical issue whether or not people show displaying flag or just ban flag from united of American forever.<br />
</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>I found two very good articles that oppose each other and that are arguing against each other. In first article, should confederate flags be kicked out of class? There had biggest issue about wear confederate flag T-shirt, or school should display confederate flag in class room. The school don’t want to their student wear T-shirt which it has confederate flag in it, and they also they want their teacher displaying confederate flag in their class room. Some students say that the flag represents slavery and oppression and that it has no place in school pperpetuating racism.  If they see any students who wear confederate flag T-shirt they will be suspended. .” Hudson High&#8217;s principal, Greg Wright, says the ban is necessary to keep the peace. He told students, &#8220;I&#8217;m a Southerner too. But we&#8217;re Americans first. That has to be our priority.&#8221; The school think confederate flag symbol of the institution of slavery and racial segregation. Also confederate flag is big issues between students; sometime student will fight with each other for what the confederate flag stand for.</p>
<p>In second article, The Confederate Flag: Symbol of Valor on Behalf of a Bad Cause by Machubin T. Owens.  Machubin T. Owens supports the confederate flag in different point of views. He thinks confederate flag is symbol of heritage and pride. He said America is free country, and we have to right to show our feeling. The slavery was not the cause of the civil war; Northerners need to avoid the sort of triumphalism that characterizes so many anti-flag editorials. For instance, when slavery was abolished in the North, Northern slave owners were more likely to sell their slaves south than to free them. In addition, many Yankees grew rich in the slave trade. During civil war, the southern people who fight for their states they fight for their pride and some of them didn’t own slavery during the war.</p>
<p>After read those two articles, I have lots of thought about whether we should display flag in the pubic place or not. The confederate flag to some people were very offense I think because those don’t want to forget what happened during civil war, they want to use this issue to remember that war. And also they really don&#8217;t want to see that happened again. However, the confederate flag to other half people, they see heritage and pride. They want to remember those people who fight for their states. Confederate flag to me is symbol of history, and we should remember what happened during civil war, I think it is good thing to know, what confederate flag is. If we can look confederate flag in different point of view, see it as part of USA history not the slavery and racial segregation. Then we can use confederate flag as learning tool, that way we can respect flag, history and other people feeling.</p>

					<p>It all started during the American Civil War when the Confederate States of America created several flags to help them define the war.  The first flag designed by the Confederate States was the Confederate flag.   The Confederate battle flag, called the &#8220;Southern Cross&#8221; or the cross of St. Andrew, has been described variously as a “proud emblem of Southern heritage and as a shameful reminder of slavery and segregation.”  The display of this flag throughout the south has brought much controversy primarily because of the disagreements it has created as to what it truly symbolizes.  The people who support the Confederate flag, mainly in the South, state that the flag is a symbol of their heritage and pride in their ancestors who survived years of war under terrible odds and sacrifice.  People who disagree with the Confederate Flag see it as a symbol of slavery, a symbol of rebellion, and even its attempt at trying to enforce racial segregation.  <strong>Ever since the ending of the American Civil War, the Confederate flag has brought much controversy of whether or not it should be acceptable for southern states to raise a flag that many American’s think symbolize racial hatred and white supremacy.    </strong></p>
<p>In this article, <a href="http://www.aestheticrealism.net/aesnyc141/aesthetics-and-life/confederacy_aesthetics.htm">Alice Bernstein</a> states that it is wrong for a confederate flag to be flown over South Carolina’s statehouse building or any other building. She states:</p>
<blockquote><p>If there had not been the desire to maintain slavery, there would have been no Confederacy and no Confederate flag at all. The Confederacy arose from something completely hideous: the feeling in persons that other human beings should be their property&#8230;. The reason the Southern states seceded from the Union in 1861 was to be able to preserve slavery&#8230;. South Carolina might just as well display a bullwhip and auction block at its statehouse, because these and the Confederate flag stand for the same thing. </p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, Bernstein is extremely unhappy with how the Confederate flag started.  If they would have just abolished slavery then the Confederate flag and the controversies that come with the flag would not be in existence.  Most flags arise from the fact that a group of people want to use a symbol to represent what they stand for.  The American flag represents the 50 states and 13 original colonies; the Canadian flag represents the Maple Leaf, a symbol of their county.  The confederate flag represents a very dark period in US history.  It says that it was acceptable to imprison people against their will and treat them so poorly that many of them died. </p>
<p>In this article, <a href="http://www.cynicalbastards.com/cynic/contrib/flag.html">Jessica Kate</a> supports the Confederate Flag in several different scenarios.  She states that the flag is a symbol of the fact that the people live in the south and also is part of the past.  She also states how it symbolizes what black people actually had to go through and what everyone else had to go through during the war including the people who died.  She states:     </p>
<blockquote><p>A good way to look at the Confederate flag is to realize that it shows how far we&#8217;ve come as a society; from having blacks as slaves to giving them freedom. Also, regardless of how painful people today think slavery was, they weren&#8217;t a part of it, so they shouldn&#8217;t have any need to fool with the subject of the confederate flag, unless they&#8217;re just out to piss off a lot of people by not only taking away a part of the tradition of the South (to hang the flag), but also by calling those people racist, when maybe they aren&#8217;t. Not all people that support the flag are racist.</p></blockquote>
<p>What Jessica is trying to say is that there is always more than one aspect to a controversy.  She discusses the many good ways in looking at this flag.  Some good ways include seeing how far we’ve come as a society, giving freedom to blacks, and even stating that they weren’t part of slavery. </p>
<p>I agree with Alice Bernstein stating that it is wrong to have the Confederate flag flown over any buildings in this society.  At one point in time, I might have agreed with its existence because of the remembrance of the revolution and the pride it represents, but it grew into a symbol of hatred and racism perpetuated by the Klu Klux Klan and other bitter southerners.  I am extremely disappointed with the existence of this flag today because it represents a place of slavery, a place of rebellion, and even a place of racial segregation.  The fact that some of us today are still honoring those three things is just preposterous. If the South really was interested in preserving its history, they might consider creating a new flag that would be widely accepted by all races as a true symbol of the past that demonstrates both the pride of the southerners and the strife that African Americans were forced to endure.</p>

					<p>The Confederate States of America was a name taken by six southern states. They withdrew from the United States government in 1860-1861 because they feared the election of Abraham Lincoln might lead to restrictions about slavery.  The first flag of the Confederate States of America was the Confederate flag which described a proud image of the Southern heritage. Over time, the Confederate flags acquired a range of meanings, contradicting one another. <strong>Since the end of the Civil War, the use of Confederate flags has stirred up much controversy because it is a sign that glorifies slavery and segregation.</strong></p>
<p><a title="Shelby Foote" href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/politics/jan-june00/flag_5-29.html">Shelby Foote</a>  is a supporter of the Confederate flag because it stood as a symbol of what his great grandfather fought for in the Civil War.  He states he is aware of the pain it may cause his African American friends, but feels they have an incorrect meaning and knowledge of confederacy noting:</p>
<blockquote><p>This country has two grievous sins on its hands. One of them is slavery - whether we&#8217;ll ever be cured of it, I don&#8217;t know. The other one is emancipation - they told 4 million people, you&#8217;re free, hit the road, and they drifted back into a form of peonage that in some ways is worse than slavery. These things have got to be understood before they&#8217;re condemned. They&#8217;re condemned on the face of it because they take that flag to represent what those yahoos represent as - in their protest against civil rights things (Foote).</p></blockquote>
<p>Foote believes that there is a misunderstanding for the confederate flag and honors it as recognition of our history.  Foote does not ignore that slavery existed in America; he acknowledges it as a “grievous sin”.  However, he believes that because of these sins, people use it as a means of defining the flag.  Furthermore, he sees it as a noble symbol that stood for much more than slavery.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cultural-expressions.com/thesis/confederate.htm">Alton H. Maddox Jr.</a> discretely opposes the Confederate flag flying atop of South Carolina’s state capitol.  He states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since Clinton is also the commander-in-chief, people of African ancestry should expect from him the same reaction if the flag of Nazi Germany were flying atop any state capitol. The federal military would invade the rebellious state and arrest the state&#8217;s top officials for committing treason.</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, he is saying that using the Confederate flag would be the same as agreeing to Nazi Germany’s communism.  Maddox’s reasoning is that “crimes against humanity were perpetrated under both flags”.  To sum up his argument, Maddox feels that the flag is a &#8220;relic of the past” with no moral or lawful reason for its existence.  Racism is clearly the biggest factor in his argument since African Americans have suffered from inferiority, noting “It is difficult to see this country elevate the rights of any non-citizen over the civil and human rights of its African citizens who are still uncompensated descendants of enslaved Africans.”</p>
<p>I agree with Maddox&#8217;s opposition for the Confederate flag because even though people may have misconceptions about what it symbolizes, it is most important to consider the perspective of African Americans.  We can not erase our history and the existence of slavery.  There are obviously people who hold the subject of segregation and inferiority in our past in great despair.  I am deeply concerned that this flag still is used today, seeing that there is so much controversy about it.  The problem is that the flag is displayed publicly.  We need to take into consideration that certain people are affected by our past in a negative way and being publicly displayed further reminds them of their hurtful past.  I feel the best solution would be for those honoring the flag to hang it in their homes less openly.  This way, the Confederate flag is not being destroyed; we are simply respecting how others may feel.</p>

					<p>In the past five decades society’s perception of women has changed. In the 1950’s, women were homemakers and men we the heads of the home. However, in the average American home does not consists of these two elements. Today, the perception of women is much different than the times our parents.  Over the years women have become equal to men in the home and in the workplace. </p>
<p>The 1950’s were a different world than what it is today. During WWII, lives changed for everyday Americans. Women could not stay at home and be housewives any longer, they had to go out into the workforce while the men were off at war. For years, the women were heads of households, but that all changed once the war ended.  When the 1950’s came around, society tried to put life back in order the way it was before.  The men went off to work each morning and the women were sent back to the homes where they belonged. It was in this time that the Feminist movement began.  At this time in history, and decades before, women were housewives, who came second to men. Women were forced to act, dress, and present themselves in specific ways without any argument. In the cooking clip, it shows how a woman, back in the 50’s, got married and then was tied down to a life of housework and pleasing her husband.  <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=x4qDn0wq4Ng">&#8220;Cooking Terms!&#8221;</a> This clip taught woman how to cook in order to serve her husband.  </p>
<p>As we all know, women are not perceived in this light any longer. Women are no longer expected to stay at home while the men go to work.  Women are even considered equal to men in the workforce, receiving equal jobs and wages.  Women today have come a very long way from where they were just five decades before.  </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPTwyET00X0">Stepford Wives</a> is a movie about a group of perfect families residing in a small town in present-day Connecticut. They were the perfect families because the husbands went to work each morning while the wives stayed home and mended the house.  The women were perfect. They were blondes, they always looked presentable, and they were always second to their husbands.  However, nothing is as it seems, the actual wives were made into robots by their husbands controlled with a remote.  The clip I chose is with Bette Midler’s character as a robot and all of the abilities that make her a perfect wife.  The Stepford Wives, As you can see, not only is her character gorgeous, she is the perfect wife. She cooks, cleans, vacuums, and mows all without ever needing to buy and appliance.  She is even equipped with being able to offer a beer after a night together. She is the perfect wife. </p>
<p>Today, I think that society tries to push more of a balanced lifestyle. No longer do women need to stay at home or either work full time. Today, it is perfectly acceptable and very common to be a working mom.  There is no question that the perception of women has changed in the past 5 decades.  There will always be a select few that feel women are lesser than men, however, as a whole, I think the our society has finally found an equal way of life for us to live. </p>

				<small>April 17th, 2007 <!-- by jburton7 --></small>

					<p>The roles of the everyday woman has changed dramatically throughout history, especially in the last 40 years or so. In the 50’s and 60’s a woman was expected to live for the role of housewife. She was to tend to her children and husband, cooking and cleaning constantly. In the current century a family is still labeled ‘normal’ when the roles are reversed, a man stays home and the woman earns the income. This is due to the ever changing views of society. <strong>Due to the strife of women to prove equal to men in the workplace, the changing depictions of women in different forms of media, and through increased interest in sexuality in our society, the definition of a ‘housewife’ has gained multiple meanings. </strong></p>
<p>The 1950’s and 60’s idea of a housewife can be seen in this video of ‘<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=3dOviPRMoyQ">cooking terms</a>.’ In this video we see a woman who has just been married, the narrator introduces that the honeymoon is now over and its time for her to ‘enter her new kitchen.’ This line shows how at that time, the kitchen was truly thought to be a woman’s place. The video goes on to say that the woman is worrying over the thought of her ability to surprise her husband and produce as great quality of food as his mother. This shows that even women supported the view and their complying actions constricted them to the role. The narrator makes a point of saying that you have to know the ‘following’ terms to be successful in the kitchen, at which time the woman is shown how to ‘cream’ things and ‘mix.’ I feel that this video makes new housewives seem incompetent and inferior to those with years of marriage. However I feel this is an appropriate video that probably aired during its time, and was watched by many. The last important element of this video is the way in which the woman is dressed, extremely conservative, the viewer’s mind isn’t forced to thoughts of sex by mass cleavage being revealed.</p>
<p>The ABC sitcom, Desperate Housewives does a fairly decent job of portraying the change in the expected roles of women today. In this <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=0WV06RcJNPQ">preview</a> we see many different women, engaging in very intimate situations. The preview says “its time to come clean,” then shows two people making out. Also in the preview the women are having lunch together and one of them states that herself and her boyfriend had not had sex yet, they were waiting for marriage. At that point her friend breaks into laughter of disbelief and says, “Oh my God, you‘re serious?” In this previews one minute entirety eight make out scenes are shown, half of which the women are seen in their bra’s and underwear. Just as the preview is about to show the scenes the narrator says “its time for love.” Lastly, the women in this video are dressed more casual and revealing, many of them reveal cleavage when fully dressed, and in the end they are all dressed to fit our society’s view of ‘sexy.’</p>
<p>These two videos differ dramatically, yet both accepted of their time periods. Women have strived to become equal to men in the workplace, therefore changing society’s perceptions and norms from that of the first video, a strict role as housewife, to a more dynamic role acceptance. Also the perceived role a woman should fit has been altered over the years dramatically by media, as we see, the first video is an example of a show aired in the 50’s and 60’s then we shift to the shows common of our time of sex and drama filled relationships, such as Desperate Housewives. I feel the most important and most dramatic factor that has changed the role of women over time is the increased interest and acceptance of sex in our society. Through years of increased nudity and women’s coming into the role as a sexual partner, society has gradually become more desensitized and come to appreciate sex. The phrase “sex sells,” is a common marketing term throughout our society today. This term differs greatly from the target market of the 50’s and 60’s, the housewife of cooking and cleaning. My reaction to the first video was that it was stupid, why would someone watch something so boring and pointless? I viewed the clip as a joke, so I began to analyze why I felt this way. At which point one must imagine how viewers of the 50’s and 60’s would react to an episode of Desperate Housewives, where sex, adultery, and drama are the focus. I’m sure that the viewers of that time period would feel the same way I did towards the video of their time. Most would probably be disgusted, and it would probably be categorized as extremely immoral, pointless. Throughout time the role of women has changed, women are no longer restricted to the role of conservative, cooking and cleaning housewives. The role a woman plays in society has evolved to such a dynamic mold, those who stay true to the ‘old fashioned’ ways, and those who have come to chose who they want to be, and what roles they would like to play in society.</p>

					<p>     In the 1950s it was thought that women only care about the elegance, comfort and other visually appealing features of a car. It was never thought that they would take interest in the mechanical and performance aspect of the car. In modern times women are changing the standard for what type of cars they prefer and it has developed into something very different from the 1950s.  <strong>Over the decades women have developed a different thinking and outlook on the world of automobiles.</strong><br />
   </p>
<p>     I chose to view the video clip <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3qXeZpM__4">“Oldsmobile What Women Want”</a>. This video seemed to be a training video for 1950s Oldsmobile sales associates. It covered what the associates should focus on when selling cars to women. It portrayed woman as people who only cared about the visually appealing features of a car. The video addressed how women only liked the rich quality and the feel of richness in a car. The wide range of colors was something else that the video said appealed to women when purchasing a car. Also mentioned was that women would be interested in the feeling of the interior fabric design like she would on a dress. From this one can assume that the main attire for women was dresses back then. It also talked about how the seat belts of the car were perfect for women because they would not hook the dress under the handle and tear it. This statement again implying that women’s main clothing was a dress.  The video also stated that if the woman is with her husband then the sales associate would not be able to get all of her attention versus if she was shopping alone. So it seems back then if a couple went shopping for a car then it would be the man who made most of the decisions and the women would just accompany the husband but have no real opinion in what car to buy.<br />
     The other video that I viewed was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLnBZA8aMB8">“</a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLnBZA8aMB8">Woman Driver: The Katherine Legge Story Promo”</a>. This told the story of Katherine Legge, a British auto racing driver who is the first women to race a Formula One car in the Champ Car World Series. Everyone predicted that she would fail and not prosper and they said she’s a female in a man’s world. But she worked very hard, was dedicated and proved that she could race a Formula Once car. In a game that crushes the strongest men she won the series opener at Long Beach, in doing this she became the first woman to win a major race in North America. She later went on to win her second and third races at Edmonton and San Jose. This story proves that women have come a long way in the automobile world. It shows that they don’t care merely about the looks of the car nowadays, but that they are interested in understanding the mechanics and performance of the car. I also believe the Legge is a good role model for young girls who are interested in race cars and the mechanics of cars in general. Looking at this story it&#8217;s obvious that women’s thought on cars has no doubt changed from the 1950s.<br />
     </p>
<p>     The Oldsmobile video really just made women look like dummies when it came to cars. It showed them as someone who had no brains and that the sales associate could sell them cars by fooling them into buying a car because of how nice it looked and how elegant and luxurious it was regardless of the performance side of the car. In the 1950s it was thought that the husband would do all the thinking and talking about cars because females were not supposed to know anything about the topic. But looking at the Katherine Legge video it is apparent and evident that women have a new viewpoint in regard to cars. The Legge story shows how a women doesn’t just want to drive a car because of looks but that some women are really into the mechanics and performance aspect of cars.  In 50 years there has never been an intensely competitive female driver in the race world but with Legge’s appearance that has changed. In the 1950s it would have been unimaginable for a woman to drive a race car especially after looking at the Oldsmobile video.  But Legge has proven that women are also interested in car&#8217;s performance and not just the visually appealing and luxurious aspect of cars as they were in the 1950s.<br />
         <br />
     I’m sure though some women still fit into the category of the Oldsmobile video but that’s not the case with many women. Many women nowadays are concerned about the type of performance that their car will give them and that is something they consider when buying a new car. Personally I have a female relative who is very interested in rally cars and she drives a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX.  The Evolution IX is a rally car that is all about performance with very minimal luxury features. So from this we can see that in today’s trends more and more women are favoring the performance and mechanical side of cars versus the elegance and luxury. It is very true that over the decades women have begun to change their perception of cars.<br />

					<p>Women have always been characterized and looked at differently by society as time has passed on through the years. From the way women are looked at in the kitchen and household, how women are looked at by men and their relationships with them, and to how women think about things they buy like an automobile. <strong>Over the time from the 50&#8217;s to present day today, some things have not changed, but a lot of the ways we viewed women today have changed since then.</strong></p>
<p>The movie that I looked at from youtube is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dOviPRMoyQ">Cooking Terms</a> video. I thought that this movie degraded women and made them look like they had no intelligence and could not figure out the basic thing associated with cooking. In the beginning of the movie it shows Margie not being able to figure out the basics of creaming the butter and putting cream into the batter instead of creaming the butter and it messed up her cake. In todays society women are not looked at like that. However, most of the time women are the ones associated with cooking, but in the society today, they are looked at as intelligent individuals and not just a woman who can not figure out the basic things in a cookbook. We do not think of them not being able to follow directions. Another thing is it shows Margie&#8217;s husband going off to work and her staying home with nothing to do, but to cook for her newlywed husband of hers. This is really typical of life in the 50&#8217;s and what was expected of women, to stay home and take care of the house and cook for her husband. Today even though some women are housewives there are also plenty of working woman that do not stay home and have educated jobs. Back in the 50&#8217;s that was very rare to find, a woman working and not staying home. So that is something that has changed. Even though most of the woman that work do come home and make dinner, it is not unusual for a guy to make dinner like it was back then. The other thing that I noticed was how Margie served her husband, like she was his servant. She cut the cake then served him first and then herself. Today women are not expected to serve their husband. Men are expected to be able to get their own food for themselves and not be waited on.<br />
Today the way women are viewed has changed significantly since the 50&#8217;s. In this clip I found of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzEh-3sqiK4">30 minute meals</a>(which is very bad recording and very bad clip by someone with nothing to do) it is proving how things have changed over time. Yes, it is still portraying women in the kitchen, but the show is to show how to make a dinner in 30 minutes or less. This is showing that women are not staying home and that they are out working and do not always have the time to make dinner and this is an easy way to do it. In the video from the 50&#8217;s all the things that were made were time consuming because all the women in the 50&#8217;s were portrayed to have all the time during the day. This is not the cause today because women are working and are not expected to stay at home and cook and clean.</p>
<p>There is another show from today, Food 911 on the food network and its hosted by Tyler Florence. I could not find a clip to show of it, but it is a how to show on cooking. It shows how to make certain foods that people have trouble with. This proves how times has changed because it is hosted by a guy. Back in the 50&#8217;s it would be pretty rare to see a cooking show hosted by a guy, or being portrayed doing a job that back then was thought of as a job that was suppose to be done by a woman. Its proving that women are not looked at as they need to be the ones in the kitchen making dinner in todays societ, that guys are capable of being in a kitchen too. I think it is putting women on an equal level with men, like they should be.</p>
<p>Even though women are still looked at today by some people not equal to men, it is no where close to how it was in the 50&#8217;s. Things have changed over that time span and women are looked at as very intelligent individuals today, not so much then. So even though some people think that women have not made a big movement and are still looked at as lesser individuals by some, it is by far no where close to how they were looked at and thought of back then.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Throughout history, women have been characterized in many different ways, and unfortunately it is usually in a negative way. During the 1950&#8217;s, it was a popular stereotype that women were homemakers. Although this is not necessarily negative, many men expected this of their wives and women who did not fall into this stereotype were considered to be socially abnormal. Today a few different stereotypes permeate throughout our country, including women as purely sexual objects to women choosing to work neglating their families. Overtime, stereotypes may have changed but still do exist amongst women of today. <strong>The stereotypes of women have changed overtime from housewife to sexual objects, the main theme of  women being subservient to men has continued throughout the generations.</strong></p>
<p>While watching the video, &#8220;<a title="Cooking Terms!" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dOviPRMoyQ&amp;NR=1">Cooking Terms!</a>&#8221; there are many examples of the main stereotype women faced in that day and age as a homemaker. In the opening of the video, we are introduced to Tim and Margie, who are newlywed&#8217;s. Almost immediately we are introduced to the typical roles of husband and wife in the 1950&#8217;s; men went to work and women stayed home to cook. The video states, &#8220;The honeymoon is over for Tim now that he starts back to work. And it&#8217;s over for Margie as she enters her bright, new kitchen to cook her first meal. Yes, can she cook Tim&#8217;s favorite meals, just as his mother used to make?&#8221; The woman is expected to stay home and cook for her husband. Not only is she expected to cook for him, but also to make what he requests and up to his standards. In this scene, you can see how women were expected to please their husbands, with no real thought of themselves.</p>
<p>Another scene that promotes this idea of women being subservient to men occurs when Margie attempts to cook a cake for Tim. However, she misunderstands the cooking term to &#8220;cream&#8221; butter and the cake comes out wrong. The video states how Tim will be suprised and disappointed that Margie ruined the cake. Margie then appears in the scene to be very upset and worried that she cannot cook to please her husband. This is another example of the woman not doing something because she really wants to, but to please her husband. Because she incorrectly cooked the cake, her husband will be disappointed in her. You get the sense from this scene that because Margie cannot cook, she will not make a fit wife.</p>
<p>Finally, near the end of the video, Margie learns what all the terms mean and realizes there is a glossary in the back of her cookbook in case she has any more questions. The video states, &#8220;Now Tim will never have to know about how Margie ruined her first meal.&#8221; This statement again inforces the idea that a woman who cannot cook is regaurded as a failure in the eyes of her husband. The video even goes so far as to say this is one of the most important things you can do in your marriage and throughout your &#8220;career as a cook&#8221;. Therefore, obviously, you are not successful in your life as a homemaker if you cannot cook. These women were expected to please their husbands with their cooking skills and seemingly were considered failures if they could not do this task.</p>
<p>Although women today are not always expected to stay at home and cook for their husbands, there are still ways in which women are subjected to the idea that men are superior in status. For example, many music videos, especially from the rap industry, portray women to be purely glorified sexual objects, at the disposal of men. For example, in the Akon video &#8220;<a title="Smack That" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NInlZ1MnC0">Smack That</a>&#8220;, women are shown in skimpy clothing, dancing around for the men. Even the lyrics of the song are easily recognized as purely sexual, &#8220;Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Taebo/And possibly bend you over look back and watch me/Smack that all on the floor/Smack that give me some more/Smack that &#8217;till you get sore/Smack that oh-oooh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another example of women becoming subservient to men is in the workforce. Constantly there are stories arising of women doing the same work as men, however, they are payed less. Also, there are consistently lawsuits filed by women about being sexually harrassed by men in the workplace. One example of this is a video on YouTube entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGudma-ZY8o">Sexual Discrimination Educational Video</a>&#8220;. This video does a great job of showing things that typically happen to women in the workplace, except it tries to make a joke of the entire thing. The opening credits read, &#8220;How to deal with whiny women&#8221;.</p>
<p>Another scene shows a man (presumably the woman&#8217;s boss), greeting her by name and then smacking her on the butt. The narrator then comes in to tell what he did &#8220;wrong&#8221;, and explains you should not call a woman by her name, but instead refer to women in pronouns or verbs such as &#8220;you&#8221; or &#8220;move&#8221;. While this video may be intended for humor, it is these attitudes that continue to degrade women in today&#8217;s society.</p>
<p>As you can see, while stereotypes of women have seemed to evolve over time, I believe the main focus has continued over time. Women are still expected in many cases to answer to men, whether it is in the household or, today, in the workplace. It is unfair and unjust that this discrimination continues into the 21st century. A woman should have the option to do what she wishes, whether it is to become a stay at home mom, or a CEO of a corporation.</p>

				<h2><a href="/courses/history120/spring07/movie-review-da-vinci-code.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Movie Review: Da Vinci Code">Movie Review: Da Vinci Code</a></h2>
				<small>April 5th, 2007 <!-- by spierce5 --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p align="center"><strong>The Da Vinci Code</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Stephen Pierce</strong></p>
<p>To summarize the movie for those who have not seen it: this movie&#8217;s plot is based on the idea that Christ married Mary Magdalene and sired a child by her, and that this proved his mortality.  According to the movie, the Priory of Sion was formed to protect the evidence proving Christ&#8217;s mortality, then to reveal it at a preordained time.  Their adversaries in the movie are a small sect within the Catholic Church, Opus Dei, who possess knowledge of Christ&#8217;s mortality, and who seek to destroy evidence of it to preserve the power of the Church.</p>
<p><strong>The &#8220;Da Vinci Code&#8221; is a enjoyable work of fictional entertainment; however it tends to abuse history in its attempts to be believable.</strong>  To borrow Lewis Black&#8217;s theory from &#8220;Man of the Year&#8221;,</p>
<p>Black: &#8220;TV scares me. It makes everything seem credible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Secret Service Agent: &#8220;Why&#8217;s that so bad?&#8221;</p>
<p>Black: &#8220;Well, if everything seems credible, then nothing seems credible. Y&#8217;know, TV puts everybody in those boxes, side-by-side. On one side, there&#8217;s this certifiable lunatic who says the Holocaust never happened; and next to him, is this noted, honored historian, who knows all about the Holocaust; and now there they sit, side-by-side. They look like equals! Everything they say seems to be credible! And so, as it goes on, nothing seems credible anymore. We just stop listening.&#8221;</p>
<p>The information presented in the movie varies from historically accurate to patently false, but both are shown, as Black says, “side-by-side”, blurring the truth.  For example, the blade and chalice, by cursory Google search of several sources, are found to indeed represent male and female, as the movie suggests.  However, the Priory of Sion was an association formed in France in 1956 and is NOT an ancient cult. The story is a bit long, but suffice it to say that the founder, Pierre Plantard, aspired to have himself instated as king of France.  To that end, he attempted to make up a long history for the Priory, with himself as a long lost heir to the throne, even going so far as to forge historical documents.  See <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priory_of_sion">Priory of Sion</a></u> and <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Plantard">Pierre Plantard</a></u> .</p>
<p>The real confusion of history with this combination of truth and fiction stems from the convincing way it is presented in the movie.  At the very beginning, the viewer is put in the place of the audience to which Professor Langdon is giving a lecture.  This lecture is all about how history can be misinterpreted given a bias, and how one must always seek the truth.  This sets up the viewer with the idea that Langdon seeks the truth, and is the viewer&#8217;s advocate for truth in the movie, that is he is “on our side”.  This plays into an interesting argumentative technique that Dan Brown (author of the book) uses to lend credibility to his work.  We (the viewers) are shown the movie from the point of view of the un-knowledgeable.  We are made to trust Professor Langdon as our knowledgeable friend who seeks truth throughout the movie, so as he is convinced, we are convinced. Take, for example, the scene</p>
<p>Again, later in the movie, we are put in the position of Sophie Neveu – and again, un-knowledgeable on matters of history – and we watch the debate between Langdon and Teabing about whether or not the premise of the movie is true, that Christ was married to Mary Magdalene and fathered a child.  The argument follows a progressive pattern: at first, Langdon is the ultimate skeptic, smiling condescendingly at Teabing, making counterpoints to his points; by the end, however, Langdon&#8217;s counterpoints sound like a face-saving move on his part as he grudgingly admits that he might be wrong.  This is a twist on the <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method">Socratic Method</a></u> of argument.  As an example:</p>
<p>Langdon: [refering to the argument of whether or not Mary Magdalene was Jesus&#8217; wife] 	“This&#8217;s just an old wive&#8217;s tale!”</p>
<p>Teabing: “The original one in fact.”</p>
<p>Langdon: “There&#8217;s virtually no imperical proof!”</p>
<p>Teabing: “He knows as well as I do, there&#8217;s much evidence to support it.”(speaking to Sophie)</p>
<p>Langdon: “Theories. There are theories.”</p>
<p>The stylistic elements of intensity and gritty realism play into the believability of the film.  Everything in the movie is true to real life in that it is a plausible – there are no over-the-top special effects to detract from the realistic situations in the movie.  The music is darkly suspenseful, and the lighting is low.  Actors always seem to have looks of purposeful determination on their faces, when not otherwise occupied with lines.  The movie comes of as a “find-the-hidden-treasure” (National Treasure, The Goonies, Treasure Island) with a “time-is-running-out!” feel.  The level of violence also adds to the intensity.</p>
<p>This movie was intended for those with a cursory knowledge of history, specifically the religious history of Catholic, Christian, and Jewish faiths.  There is a great deal of reference to various historical symbols (the Blade and Chalice, the Rosacrucion cross, etc.), people (Leonardo Da Vinci, Isaac Newton, Jesus Christ, Mary Magdalene), places (the Vatican, the Rose Line, Rosslyn Chapel, Newton&#8217;s Grave at Westminster Abbey), and objects (the Mona-Lisa, the Last Supper,the Holy Grail).  Armed with this knowledge, the audience is able to ascertain that the objects, people and places are real, but still have to rely on the characters&#8217; specific knowledge – or misinformation – to understand the plot.</p>

					<p align="center">Movie Review -Schindler’s List</p>
<p>The movie Schindler’s List, directed by Steven Spielberg in 1993 and based on <em>Schindler’s Ark </em>written by Thomas Keneally. <strong>Is based on the true story of Oskar Schindler, a Nazi Czech, who uses cheap Jewish labor to make his fortune in WW2, but is changes his motives and saves over 1000 Polish Jews from execution. </strong>Schindler’s List is based on the Holocaust in the 1940’s where Jewish followers were killed off just because of their faith to Judaism. Not only were Jewish people targeted but the gypsies and disabled as well. On May 9<sup>th</sup>,1945 the Nazis surrendered, killing 9-18 million people.</p>
<p>The purpose of the movie was to educate the younger generation on how brutal the Holocaust was and to still provide a voice to the millions of people who died. It also showed that people did try to help and not everyone was bad, example Oskar Schindler. At first he was greedy and wanted fortune with hiring the Jews, but soon realized how much he could help and turned around and saved over 1000 people. I thought that it was very accurate to history and used it to its advantage. It even was in black and white to give it more of an effect.</p>
<p>I think this movie was intended for the younger generation that did not experience this and it was starting to become more of a history topic than a topic that needed to be remembered. I honestly think that if we didn’t have history to guide us, after 9-11 maybe something like this would of happened to Muslim people living in America? History will always repeat itself but it is up to the people to make sure that the bad doesn’t repeat itself.</p>
<p>The style of this movie was a Historical Drama with a little romance thrown in. I thought it was a good idea for this movie to be in the category drama so the audience could relate to the character more. By having this movie made in black and white made it more authentic to time of the holocaust. The movie had some splashes of color, that made some scenes stand out. Such as a scene with a little girl with a red jacket, and we follow her in bits of the movie, and at then end you see that red jacket being thrown with the dead bodies.</p>
<p>Schindler’s List was a movie to show the lives of the millions of Jew that were killed because of their religion. I thought that this movie was very close to capturing life and keeping it strong in our hearts.</p>

					<p>The civil war was the one of the most gruesome wars the US has ever been in. It was fought in over 10,000 different locations. To today, it is the war with the most amounts of US casualties, over 650,000 soldiers killed. It seems as though it would be a difficult task to completely turn oneself into a person of the 1800’s. But with lots of practice and studying, civil war re-enactors are able to recreate history.<strong> Civil War reenactments are meant to teach educate the public about the war because re-enactors do not want it to be forgotten.</strong> Reenactments are an amazing teaching tool; it is as if having the war happen right in front of your own eyes.<strong> </strong>A re-enactors goal is to educate you on the war that overwhelmed our country from 1861–1865. The main purpose of a Civil War re-enactor is to keep history alive and keep today’s generation from forgetting about the most devastating war the US has ever been in.<br />
They bring a piece of history back to life in a way that a movie could never do. There are four main categories of Civil war re-enactments:</p>
<p><strong>Living Histories-</strong> this includes weapons demonstrations(how to shoot and load a gun),  and portraying the everyday life on a normal soldier. These re-enactors use the same types of equipment, such as guns and tents, and eat the same food that was around during this war.</p>
<p><strong>Public Demonstrations- </strong>smaller versions of scripted battles. These battles are more loose interpretation of actual battles of the war.</p>
<p><strong>Tactical battles- </strong>These battles are not open to the public. They are fought like real life battles and each side must come up with they’re own strategies to beat the enemy. While scripted battles and public demonstrations are done for public interests, tactical battles are fought for private viewings.<br />
 </p>
<p><strong>Scripted battles- </strong>These battles are planned so that each side fights the same way the actual Union and Confederate soldiers fought. This type of battle is most often viewed because of safety and public satisfaction.</p>
<p>            Civil war re-enactors are only able to reproduce a small part of the Civil War, but that small part that they are able to bring back to life is done with such accuracy that it leaves one to believe they are actually witnessing a war. Civil war reenactments offer much more than just a battle. Some had only the battle of its hometown, while many others had duels, fashion shows, and meet and greets with a person or soldier of the civil war period. They demonstrate the creation of different tools that were needed and even practiced church services. Re-enactments are available almost anywhere. The National Civil War Association even has links that can help one organize events for schools.</p>

					<p>A huge part of what history is is finding clues and piecing them together. Especially difficult is figuring out pieces of history from hundreds of years ago. There are always hints that lead to another and lead to another before any real important facts are discovered. <strong><u>National Treasure</u> is a historical puzzle because it is several clues that are pieced together to get to the end of a treasure hunt.</strong> Ben Gates is a historical analyst who goes on a journey to piece together a mystery that has been passed down throughout his family for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>The overall goal of this movie is to tell the story of a hunt for a treasure that’s worth is inconceivable to even think of. In <u>National Treasure</u>, Ben Gates goes on a quest to find a hidden treasure that was buried somewhere underneath ‘The Charlotte’ by the group the Masons. He pieces together the clues that have been passed down through his family since the 1800’s. The first clue is that “it lies beneath The Charlotte.” They are then brought to a clue that is on the back of the Declaration of Independence, which next brings them to the Liberty Bell in New Jersey. They finally find the large treasure underneath a church in a hidden underground room. To make the search even harder, millionaire Ian Howe is trying to beat them to the treasure to claim as his own, even if it means killing anyone that gets in his way.</p>
<p>The writers of this movie did a great job at twisting our everyday American symbols, (the liberty bell, the Declaration of Independence, American currency), into being clues for the movie. One set of clues I found most interesting was the numbers on the back of the Declaration of Independence that linked with the Silence Dogood letters. The numbers were actually a key to decode a secret message from a group of letters Benjamin Franklin wrote to a newspaper under the name of Silence Dogood. The message, &#8220;The vision to see the treasured past, comes as the timely shadow crosses in front of the house of Pass and Stow,” leads them to the Liberty bell.<br />
            The story behind the hidden treasure is very interesting.  The treasure was passed to different nationalities of people, including the Egyptians and Romans, for thousands of years. Its value increased every time it was stolen and taken to a new country. When the Masons got a hold of it, they decided to burry the treasure because they didn’t believe that any man could handle that amount of wealth, not even a king. They left behind a bunch of clues that would lead to the treasure so that it would not be completely forgotten.</p>
<p> I think that this movie could help kids find history even more fascinating than it already is. If an adult like me found this movie to be mesmerizing, I know a kid would probably find it even better. With its rating of PG and being created by  Disney, I think it was intended for all ages and to be a movie to make anyone spellbound by history like so many of us were in our younger age.</p>
<p>            This movie is very much historical fiction; while there are many real historical facts and symbols, I honestly don’t believe that there is a map made of these symbols that lead to a treasure. Although they bent the truth a lot in different scenes, I think they did it for good reasons which led the viewers to think, “what if this really was true.” I googled some of the “facts” from the movie to see if they were actually true, and some of the facts really were facts. One of the clues was a group of letters written by Silence Dogood, in reality she really was the first pseudonym that Benjamin Franklin created. It was impressive how Gates was able to piece together long forgotten clues to find the treasure that our founding fathers had buried so long ago. It seemed as though this was going to be a never ending puzzle, but in the end was finally solved and like all Disney movies, had a happy ending.</p>

</strong>The movie’s overall message is that you shouldn’t judge anyone by the color of their skin. Everyone is the same it’s there skin color is different. In the beginning of the movie, it was obvious that there were two sides-black and white. As the characters began to know one another, they slowly began to unite as one side. The process from beginning to the end is not easy and it clearly shows us that anything is possible. The goal was to show us that working together with our differences can happen by, talking to someone of a different skin color and getting to know them. Setting back hundreds of years ago, everyone knows that racism has always been a big issue and for it to be mention in a movie in today’s society is good because it is very important and it will teach us we can work together despite our skin color.</p>
<p>The movie sets back in 1971 where racism was a problem in each individual’s daily life. The way that the African-Americans were treated definitely shows us that people did not care for them and were always mistreated. The choices that the people have made in the movie lets us know that the African-Americans were always the victims. In the movie, you see tension when Herman Boone movies into his new neighbor while everyone is staring at him like he doesn’t belong there. This incident in particular shows us that African-Americans were always the problem and is always targeting the African-American community.</p>
<p>As a citizen, racism still exists in today’s society. Although the movie has a happy ending, it is not always like that. People see this awful situation in films and in real life situations and would think that this needs to stop. The intended audience for this film is for everyone from kids to adults. There is no specific age group because anyone is welcome to watch this film that teaches a strong message about race. This film is for everyone because it states a clear strong message about racism that everyone should know about.</p>
<p>The genre of Remember the Titans is drama and of course, sports. Seeing from an African-American and white persons eye, you see how this becomes a historically big issue.  Racism which is a serious issue is portrayed as if you were living in that time because if you were living at that time period, you will know exactly how the characters felt. The problems that the African-Americans and the whites faced are something that is realistically true. At first, they will not like each other and respect each other. As they do get to know each other, they will slowly become friends. Realistically, in today’s society, it is not easy to get along with someone that has a different skin color. Due to the fact that racism has occurred many years ago, it will take a long time to be someone friend.</p>
<p>This film and the past which did experience racism clearly show that it is stoically factual. For example, there’s a scene where two different colored men becomes friends. Being friends, the white man introduces his girlfriend to his African-American friend. While introducing the African-American friend to his girlfriend, she hesitates and leaves him. Towards the end of the movie, the girlfriend accepts the white man’s friend and actually talks to him. This incident clearly shows that you can see this everywhere in today’s society. This scene in particular shows us that we are first hesitant to meet someone out of our own race but once we get to know someone, we are willing to try to get to know them.</p>
<p>Overall, this film shows us that we are the same person from everyone else. The only difference from each other is our skin color. This serious issue has divided the citizens in the United States. As we begin to move forward we are slowly beginning to undivided the like that has separated us for hundreds of years. Like the film, the beginning clearly shows us that there is hatred within the community but as they get to know each other every passing day, they slowly get along and become great friends despite the color of their skin.</p>

				<small>April 4th, 2007 <!-- by lsang1 --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>If you were anything more than four or five years old in April of 1970, then you almost certainly remember Apollo 13, America moon mission gone wrong. For everyone else, there the movie Apollo 13, a thoroughly competent if uninspired film that provides a relatively faithful retelling of the gripping story of what happened to the spacecraft some 300,000 kilometers from earth, and how it managed to come home safely. <strong>This is movies really showed us how one mission can untied whole country and people will do whatever take to help each other. Even American didn’t complete the mission.<br />
</strong>there was one scene right before they are going to shoot the mission all the American were watching TV and some of them were watching on live. I think they really care about this is mission; because they want to mission will fly to moon successful. That shows how American loves their country and care about their country.</p>
<p>All movies on back of list and I choice Apollo 13, because I really like space mission, and always want to know more about out space. This movie really gets me into it, because it didn’t showed lots of space knowledge, but it shows how people can work together as team. Though this movie I can tell people back then were all close together. When Tom hanks said we have problem, all people work so hard try getting them out space. Also all American were supporting their heroes and pray for them. That makes people stay together as one.</p>
<p>There are lots of movies about space mission. However, I think apollo13 was the greatest movie about space mission, because people can really see what happened when people were in space. Also movie want to show how people can solve problem in space. Also this movie is telling us, if we can work together as team, we can fix all problems no matter how hard problem we have. </p>
<p>Space is unknown place for most people who live on earth, and people really want to know what is going on outside space. This Movie had lots of picture about spacecraft; they really showed how people live in spacecraft and what kind problems they have to fact it.  Apollo 13 movie bring history live again, I think if people want to know what happening in Apollo 13, when they watch this is movie. They will have better understanding how they went though.</p>
<p>They made this movie to intended young audience and students who really want to know space mission, also this is movie intended people who really like intense and emotional movie.  There is other the most important why people want to watch this movie was they used leading star Tom Hanks, Becon and Paxton. I think Hanks, Bacon and Paxton do a solid job of playing astronauts in this movie. They really show lots of anxiety and intensely in this movie, which brings watcher’s heart up and down. Also the visually was good real, I couldn’t get my eye off TV one second.</p>
<p>The movie itself is really similar to what was really happening. After I watched this movie, I really understand what was really happened to Apollo 13. Because movie director ron howard did really good job in this movie, he really bring to Apollo 13 live again into movie. After I watched Apollo 13 the movie, I know why everyone has been saying the Apollo 13 mission has been called “A Successful Failure”. they didn’t complete this mission land to the moon. However, the astronauts were successfully brought home with everyone helped. The end of movie was so emotionally even they didn’t complete mission, but they got home safety. Everyone was cheering for them not because they complete mission, because they were willing to die for their county.<br />

				<small>March 7th, 2007 <!-- by gthomps7 --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><a href="http://us.imdb.com/gallery/ss/0408306/MUN_RBG1SHT45.jpg.html">Munich</a><br />
          Very select events in history have the magnitude to capture the attention of the entire world. In 1972, during the Summer Olympics, held in Munich, West Germany, the world’s attention was unequivocally captured.  Eight men associated with a Palestinian terrorist organization, <em>Black September</em>, took hostage of eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team. <strong><em>Munich</em>, the 2005 Academy Award nominated film, directed by Steven Spielberg, is a critique on Israel’s counter-terrorist actions, after the Munich Massacre.<br />
</strong><em>          Munich</em><em> </em>chronicles the lives of a group of Israeli assassins who are assigned to track down and kill 11 Palestinians believed to be architects of the Munich Massacre. The beginning portion of the movie details the events that take place at the Olympic Village, and how the hostages are killed. The second half of the movie depicts the human toll it takes to carry out the counter-terrorist acts, and the eventual outcome for the terrorist organization and Israeli government.<br />
          The underlying source of the movie and <em>Black September</em>’s actions arises out of the Israel and Palestine conflict. The clash arises between two sets of people, the Jewish Israelis and Arab Palestinians. Both sets of people are fighting over sovereignty of the land occupied in a portion of the Middle East.  Each group claims to have control over the land based on history, religion, culture, and ethnicity. The state of Israel gained sovereignty over most of the land by defeating Arab armies in two major wars: The 1948 Arab-Israeli War and the 1967 Six Day War. Over the years, there have been numerous peace talks, troop removals, and other methods of ending the conflict. None have maintained stable peace in the region.<br />
            The presence of a Jewish Israeli team was very important because precisely 27 years earlier World War II and the Holocaust had ended.  Being there symbolized the resilience of the Jewish people. On September 5, 1972, men wearing track jackets and carrying duffle bags, with guns and explosives, entered the Olympic village. They broke into the Israeli team’s apartment, killing two members of the team, and taking hostage of nine. When officials arrived, <em>Black September</em> demanded the release of 234 Palestinians and non-Arabs jailed in Israel, along with two German prisoners who were founders of the Red Army Faction. For nearly a day, the police and terrorist negotiated, to no avail. Finally, the hostages and terrorist were transported to an airfield, where they would be sent to a NATO airbase. At the airfield, German police officers created a plan to rescue the hostages. In an aborted rescue mission, the rest of the hostages and five of the eight terrorists were killed.  The remaining terrorists were put in jail, until a Lufthansa plane was hijacked, and the German government was forced to release them.<br />
Steven Spielberg has been awarded numerous awards and nominations for his direction of <em>Munich</em>.  However, the film has also been attacked by several different organizations. Both, Israelis and Palestinians, have accused the movie of being factually incorrect. The Zionist Organization of America, self pro claimed &#8220;the oldest, and one of the largest, pro-Israel/Zionist organizations in the United States&#8221;, called for a boycott of the movie. One of their criticisms was that “Spielberg attempts to humanize the Palestinian Arab killers by legitimizing their murder of Jews as their only way to establish a Palestinian state.” Other political activists also criticized the movie. Leon Wieseltier of <em><a title="The New Republic" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Republic">The New Republic</a></em> wrote, &#8220;&#8230;Worse, ‘Munich’ prefers a discussion of counter-terrorism to a discussion of terrorism; or it thinks that they are the same discussion&#8221; The criticism against <em>Munich</em> is erroneously misguided. The focus of the movie is aimed only towards Israeli use of counter-terrorism to combat terrorism. Nothing in the movie suggests that terrorism and counter-terrorism are the same thing.  However, it does advocate a futile nature of certain retaliatory actions. In the final scenes of the movie, Avner, the main character questions his case worker, Ephraim, about the purpose of their actions. “Did we kill to replace Terrorist leadership or Palestinian leadership? Everybody we killed has been replaced by worse,” Avner says. “Why do I cut my fingernails if they’ll grow back,” responds Ephraim. Told from an Israeli perspective, the movie has a slight biased. Nevertheless, it does not take a stance on who is right or wrong. The point of focusing on counter-terrorism seems to portray one overarching theme; violence begets more violence.<br />
          Stylistically, <em>Munich</em> tries to be as realistic of the events as possible. During the opening scenes of the movie, an Israeli wrestler is shot in the cheek, and then forced to lead <em>Black September</em> to the rest of the team. Graphically the scene looked very real: the blood, character expressions, and gruesomeness. Historically, it is also factual that a member of the Israeli team was shot in the cheek and forced to locate the rest of his teammates.  The story, best classified as a human drama, is very compelling, because of how the movie is photographed. The lighting for <em>Munich</em> was chosen very carefully to convey two points: everyday life and the seriousness of the situation. Compared to a love movie, like Love Actually, the lighting is extremely dark. Even on a sunny day, the sun is not illuminating the surroundings or brightening the characters face. It gives an impression that behind every corner there might be more danger. As the story progresses the lighting becomes darker. While the Israeli assassins continue to kill <em>Black September</em> agents and the stress begins to mount, the lighting changes. Avner’s face during the beginning of the film is clean-shaven and clear. During the final scenes, his beard is very rough and the lighting is much darker. <em>Munich</em> is very beautiful, in an everyday perspective. The lighting, outfits, and the language all resemble “normal” life. That familiarity allows the viewers to focus entirely on storyline, and contemplate the actions taken by Israel. <br />
          Films based on politically charged subjects, are often hard to portray accurately. <em>Munich</em> attempts, successfully in my opinion, to give a balanced perspective to an issue that goes back hundreds of years. Terrorism is a form of violence that is taking over conventional methods of warfare. Counter-terrorism is becoming the standard form of retaliation. <em>Munich</em> shows how counter-terrorism tends to lead to more terrorism. If nations are to ever stop violence, they must learn that more violence only causes hatred. Not less violence.  <em> </em></p>

					<p>The Civil War was America’s bloodiest and most costly war. It was responsible for the deaths of the most American Soldiers in history. So it seems interesting that there is such a large community who make a point of reenacting some of the war’s most exciting and legendary battles. While some members of conventional society view civil war re-enactors are “weird” or dorky,<strong> The Civil War re-enactors provide an exciting and personal look at the civil war that often gets lost among the tediousness of history books.<br />
</strong><strong>                </strong>Civil War reenactment societies take themselves very seriously. It is nearly impossible to have them break character during a reenactment. Why is this important? Civil War reenactors view themselves as teachers responsible for educating the public who watch their reenactments more about the civil war. “The NCWA is committed to educating the public about the Civil War” When learning about things, psychology has shown that you will learn things better if you take a personal interest. By reenacting battles, you give the audience characters to relate to, not just facts from a history book. Having witnessed a reenactment in Gettysburg, PA, I can tell you that it has been one of my most valuable tools for understanding and taking interest in the Civil War.</p>
<p>                Another great thing about Civil War recreation societies is there wealth of knowledge and accuracy based on years of research. They have researched to make the uniforms, lodgings, and weaponry as accurate as possible. They are truly a serious society. Take for example, The NCWA, or National Civil War Association’s website. They are committed to truly helping people understand the complexities and motivations behind the civil war.  Civil war societies are an extremely valuable and often untapped resource in regards to education of the civil war. Now, local schools often take their students to view civil war reenactments, most frequently as a visual learning tool.</p>
<p>                The most important factor of civil war recreation societies is their desire to keep the memories of the legendary civil war. The civil war is one of America’s most compelling historical moments, and these societies are important to keep the public reminded of the importance of the civil war in political, social and economic aspects in American history and America today.</p>

				<h2><a href="/courses/history120/spring07/%e2%80%9cthe-siege%e2%80%9d.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to “The Siege”">“The Siege”</a></h2>
				<small>March 6th, 2007 <!-- by Nisreen Daoud --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>“The Siege” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Siege">(Movie Info)</a> includes an all-star cast of Denzel Washington and Bruce Willis, the same actors we loved in “Man on Fire” and “Armageddon.” Islam is one of the fastest growing religions and has been a controversial issue for many years. Terrorism as well has become a very hot button issue. What do these topics have in common? “The Siege” is a movie based around the issues of terrorism and Islam. <strong>The movie is highly offensive to the Muslim religion, as it does not do a good job of distinguishing terrorism from Islam.</strong></p>
<p>The movie begins by setting up what seems to be the basis of the movie, terrorism. The U.S. takes an Islamic leader captive and brings him to America, setting off the string of terrorist attacks that soon arise in New York City. As made evidently clear throughout, the movie was made as a way to make Americans aware of the “what-ifs.” In a way, it is preparing them if anything like this may ever happen and what they should hope to see if it ever did. As well, it seems that it was made to show how terrorism and Islam are very much intertwined. As a result, the intended audience is obviously Americans. It is stirred more to the elite, older generation of Americans who know a thing or two about Muslims and are aware of world issues. This is based around the language used that is rather a little more upper level with some education needed to fully understand the entire movie. It definitely plays on the emotions of the audience. For example, there is a scene that shows the aftermath of a terrorist attack on a filled movie theatre. As the camera takes us through the theatre, we are exposed to many dead bodies as well as still living people who lost body parts they will never get back. Here, the American audience is awed and sorrowful to see what could happen to them and their tolerance toward Muslims is slowly deteriorating. </p>
<p>The movie is drama filled with action pact scenes that do a good job stirring up feelings of hate and sorrow. For example, there is a scene on a bus with a lot of little kids along with terrorists who are carrying bombs and are threatening to kill. All you can hear is the screams and moans of the children as they are terrified for their lives. Who would not be ready to run out of their house and throw all Arabs and Muslims into internment camps? Children are unquestionably a symbol for innocence and as human beings we would be horrified for anything to ever happen to them, whether they be a daughter, son, niece, nephew, or even not be in anyway related to us.</p>
<p>The U.S. should be protected and secured at all costs, no matter whom it affects, is the point of view of the movie. This is shown through the portrayal of creating internment camps in which Arab and Muslim young male adults are taken away from their families and forced to stay. Internment Camps? Weren’t we regretful for putting the Japanese in internment camps <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_American_internment">(Japanese Internment Camps)</a> during World War Two? How can we then justify putting Arabs in internment camps, even if it is just in a movie? Yes, there are terrorist, but at what cost are we willing to risk the freedoms of Muslim citizens to secure security?  It is not to say that the movie portrayed internment camps that were as bad as the Japanese, but it is still wrong and inhumane. For most of the characters in the movie, this internment camp is an acceptable action to take and is viewed as the only way to secure the safety of the American population as a whole.</p>
<p>My “favorite” part of the whole movie would have to be the last scene. Here we are, with a Muslim terrorist who is figured to be the “last cell.” We watch as he prepares to do his “duty.” The most interesting thing is what he is engaging in doing throughout the scene. Americans get to watch as he initiates a Muslim ritual of cleansing the body that is done before every prayer. When the scene first begins, it is just the “last cell” and a detective who had been helping him. She watches as he does his preparations unaware of what was to come. He explains to her that, “There will never be a last cell,” as Denzel and his partner come rushing in, only to interrupt. The scene ends with the demise of the “last cell” and the detective as well. The fact that this is placed within the movie makes it extremely hard for Americans to distinguish between Muslims and terrorists. As well, the fact that it is the last scene makes it even more unforgettable as the last scene, if any scene, is the scene that viewers never forget. In a way, it is setting a tone that all Muslims are terrorists, which is obviously historically wrong. How come the terrorists could not have been American? Or of any other race or religion than Muslim or Arab?  For decades Muslims and Arabs have been known to be “terrorists” and to be feared.</p>
<p> I am not saying that terrorism is not an important harmful act that we should just ignore or not worry about. It is undeniably something that questions our security. Though movies like “The Siege” does a good job at portraying the history of Arabs and Muslims in countries like America. So within the movie we can pick out parts that are historically correct and parts that are historically incorrect. Their portrayal of Muslims being classified as terrorists has been true for many decades. As for the fact that all Muslims are terrorists is completely wrong.  “The Siege” does a horrible job at trying to distinguish the difference between a Muslim and a terrorist and instead makes the line even murkier for Americans.<br />

					<p>The Civil War is one of the most important battles in countries. It had a major part in shaping the country into what it is today. It is important for us as a society and a country to remember what our fathers fought for. <strong>The Civil War re-enactors are there to remind us of the blood that was shed and the number of people that died fight in the countries most controversial war.</strong></p>
<p>It is easy to forget about the men and women that died for their country in this war. Part of that is due to the fact that this country has a number of immigrants flowing in each year, all of which do not understand the sacrifice that was made in order to make this country the way it is today. However, it is mostly due to the lack of interest and knowledge in the majority of the people. If it weren’t for the Civil War re-enactments we would have long forgotten the intensity of the war.</p>
<p>These re-enactments aren’t as easy and simple as most people might think. They take time and are costly. They are carefully and cautiously studied. They use correct weapons and uniforms. They try to reenact as closely as possible the war on the fields. They cover important battles and show their significance. They also portray key individuals. Some of the individuals include President Abraham Lincoln and General Lee.</p>
<p>These reenactments are done throughout the United States. They are nationally recognized by libraries, parks, and schools. When they are not on the field working, they hold events in parades, school events, and even at ceremonies. They have been great teachers to the American society and continue to do so. They show emotions and sensations that words cannot describe.</p>
<p>Aside from what they have on the field, these reenactments also hold forums that teach others of the Civil War and show its importance. The Civil War without these re-enactors would have died long ago. Their dedication and understanding for the cause of the combat keeps the fire that sparked the Civil War burning.</p>

					<p>On April 12, 1861, Southern slave states attacked a federal military installation at Fort Sumter in South California. The most complex war in American history was commenced that day. The war ended in 1865 with a victory for the North. About hundred years later, Civil War reenactment began to remember the war. It was an effort to recreate event related to the Civil War. <strong>Reenactments are serious about teaching people about the events and the consequences of the Civil War, and it tells that Americans want to preserve the memory of the most terrible conflict in our history. </strong></p>
<p>The first American Civil War reenactment website was the American Civil War Society. The goal of  the ACWS is &#8220;<em>to educate the public through as many diversified perspectives as were the issues back in 1861 - 1865.&#8221; </em>[1] They fulfill their objective by offering various activities related to the Civil War to the public. They seem to reenact politics such as Southern States Right and vulnerable pages of American history. This group portrays not only battles, but also the civilian lifestyles by providing many other activities other than just battles such as a fashion show, the field hospital, the Civil War band, and so on. They have researched and developed correct uniforms, weapons, civilian attire, and living history encampments to portray the Civil War accurately. The society sees reenactments as a means of informing Americans about the military, political, and social that were linked with the causes, events, and the aftermath of the Civil War. The society is a non-profit organization based in California. They seem successful because many people have participated in the reenactment activities, and those who have participated would learn about the Civil War.</p>
<p>Secondly, the next Civil War reenactment website was the 54th Mass Volunteer Infantry Company. This company is an African-American reenactment unit while the other two groups are living history organizations. This is a big difference from the other two groups. On the top of its web page, the company clearly states that “<em>they are portraying the experience of African American soldiers in South California.&#8221; </em>[2] They also introduce their events and activities, and their activities are all associated with African-American soldiers. Moreover, their web page gives historical information on African-American in the Civil War. This is the evidence that they only reenact African-American soldiers. The main objective of the 54th Mass is teaching the public about the Civil War and the preservation of the memory of African-American soldiers. They accomplish their goal  by going in to schools, colleges, or youth groups and educating them. The company concentrates upon presenting the history of the Civil War as it occurred in South Carolina.</p>
<p>Finally, the third Civil War reenactment website to be assessed was the National Civil War Association. The perspective from the National Civil War Association reenacts is very similar to other two groups that previously mentioned. Their goal is to educate the public about the event and people of the Civil War by  presenting living history in. National Civil War Association is committed to teaching history through reenactments, classroom visits, and lectures. Another feature that it has in common with the other two groups that it is a non-profit organization. The National Civil War Association likes to stage its events all over the US although it is based in Northern California. Schools can even arrange for the National Civil War Association to visit them by booking online. This society prides its self upon authenticity of its reenactment in terms of events depicted and the accuracy of uniforms and weapons used in its displays. [3]</p>
<p>The three groups take reenactment more seriously than just dressing up as soldiers of that conflict, and going camping in a few tents. The reenactment groups seek to be as historically accurate as possible. Even though their reenactment well researched as possible, they sometimes criticized for their sentimentalized historical portrait. However, the most significant thing about the reenactment is that it educates the public and helps to preserve the memory of the Civil War. They accomplish their goal by inviting people to reenactment events and visiting schools. As people get involved or watch the Civil War related events, people can understand better our history. People can learn the way soldiers lived and the way they fought. Moreover, people can feel soldiers’ hopes, dreams, loves, and hardships throughout portraying the events that is related to Civil War. Therefore, reenactments certainly have a potential role in teaching history in livelier way than merely reading textbooks in a classroom.</p>

					<p><strong>    Civil war re-enactors are only able to recreate a small part of the Civil War, but that small part that they are able to bring back to life is done with such accuracy that it leaves one to believe they are actually witnessing a war.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>    Civil war reenactments offer much more than just a battle. Some had only the battle of its hometown, while many others had duels, fashion shows, and meet and greets with a person or soldier of the civil war period. They demonstrate the creation of different tools that were needed and even practiced church services. I have always found reenactments to be interesting. They bring a piece of history back to life in a way that a movie could never do. My uncle plays Robert E. Lee in reenactments in Hawaii and other areas. When we visited him seven years ago we were able to watch him in action. Even though I knew him, when he put on his uniform and acted out his character, he was a totally different person. Men and women dedicate so much of their time to this show and it really shows.</p>
<p>     I found the reenactments of the civil war to be very interesting. It’s like watching a movie about it, but in real life. They reminded me a lot of Renaissance festivals that are hosted in the area a lot throughout the year. I would strongly suggest to anyone to make time one day and visit one. </p>

					<p><strong>	The Jacksonian era was a time of major upheaval, from the lives of ordinary citizens to the government and its policies, so a utopian society would have to account for these changes</strong>.  Politically, the Nullification Crisis caused quite a ripple as the power of States to disagree with the Federal Government came into question.  Socially, temperance and suffrage were in vogue.  In terms of religion, the Jacksonian era came on the heels of the Second Great Awakening.  Economically, the North and South were split into Industrial and Agricultural production respectively; also Jackson&#8217;s move to take power away from the Federal Bank resulted in some inflation and distrust of citizens in paper money.  Culturally, The role of the individual was stressed and given agency, as opposed to the days where only those of wealth and property would have a voice.  The utopian community I put forth takes the above into account. A few key assumptions/purposeful decisions about the community are: that the community is intended to exist in South Carolina and be representative of their views.</p>
<p>The community is governed by a council elected by the people (giving the common man more power), and a chairman to preside is elected by the council from their number.  Their responsibilities pick up where Federal, State and local governing bodies left off. First, they oversee the economic wellbeing of the community.  The council takes on leadership more in a business sense than a political one.  The council is also responsible for proposing laws, though the decision to enact them would be by vote of the community.  The laws&#8217; general purpose in the community is as counterparts to the religious aspect, to prevent radicalism or abuse of the community and its ideals.  The inhabitants&#8217; vote in State or Federal elections is a matter of acting in the interest of the community, so a liaison from the council would be responsible for representing them to the State legislature (and thus betting against the Federal government in a power struggle).</p>
<p>Looking to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64813312@N00/407226455/">map of the community</a> reveals the redress of many of the problems and issues of the Jacksonian era.  The center of the community is the church (citing the recent revival), which serves as a social hub to cement the relationships of those in the community.  The same building would also host the governing body.  Presumably, at least some of the land used for the construction of the utopia would be in use as farmland.  This would remain, and be run as a business by the community council.  A few factories would be constructed as a “hedge bet” against an uncertain financial future (citing the recent tariff fiasco).  The government would run both institutions: hiring employees, building more factories if that proves to be the more profitable route and keeping with the times progressively.  As paper money was trusted less (citing the fallout of Jackson&#8217;s attack on the Bank), employees would be offered a part of their salary in goods at a government owned store where the markup would be a certain percentage set by law to create one source of revenue for the government. The businesses would be jointly owned by all the citizens.  There is no place within the community where one might purchase drink (citing the temperance movement).  The factories and farms are placed in proximity to prevent a rift from forming between the employees of each, and they are placed so that there is room for growth.  As much as possible, the utopia would be self-sufficient.</p>

<p>       My utopia Freedomtown will enjoy the right to practice whatever religious beliefs they want, so long as their religion abides by our peaceful laws, which strictly prohibit violence, stealing, and any other wrongful acts committed against our people. Citizens who are agnostic or atheist are also welcome in our community too. Citizens who are not respectful of other people’s various religious beliefs will be reprimanded and asked to leave our community if the problem persists.</p>
<p>          Our community is set up in a way that encourages individuality and respects the differences of everyone. These differences in ideas and beliefs should be respected by all, and everyone should learn to get along with everyone. Everyone in our town will be regarded as equal, regardless of race, religion, and gender. We would also like to be known as the community with the lowest crime rate. <strong>The ultimate goal of Freedomtown is too create a community with a variety of different people with various religious philosophies to all live peacefully together.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>         Due to our community’s vast differences in beliefs our community realizes the challenges of our town being considered a utopia. However, once people understand the way of life of Freedomtown they will see that it is achievable. Our community encourages the idea of expressing yourself and ideas openly. No religion is seen as right or wrong in the eyes of the community. All townspeople will learn to respect the differences of religious beliefs and opinions, and if certain people cannot abide by this than they will be forced to leave our community. </p>
<p>         Freedomtown will be a mix of urban and rural communities. Our town has its industrial factories located across the river separated from our farms, houses, and public buildings. We have a couple of parks and one big one that will be the social gathering spot for our various events. Our community will be a capitalist economy, which will allow people to own businesses and create revenues as long as it is done peacefully without exploiting people. Our businesses will be allowed to import and export goods to and from other communities. Freedomtown will be a mix of agricultural and industrial businesses, and taxes will be administered in order to pay our public officials and to improve our community as necessary. Social events will be held in the parks every weekend, which will allow the town to get together and socialize around music, beer, and dancing. Everyone is expected to go, but the choice belongs to the residents of our community.  </p>
<p>         Our community will have no one leader in charge instead it will be a leader-by-committee, which will consist of 12 people. The 12 people will be voted in by the people and remain on the board for no longer than 7 years. The rules of Freedomtown are strictly enforced by our town police department. Our town will also have judges that will listen to cases involving residents who have broken laws. The judges will have absolute power and have the ultimate deciding factor of whether or not it is necessary to ban the resident for his act. If a person has been declared banned from the community, he or she has the chance to appeal to a panel of 3 judges. If two out of the three Judges rule in favor of banning the resident than that person must leave Freedomtown within 3 days. A person who is banned may be allowed to come back to the community after 5 years but must have a majority vote approved by the 12 leaders of the community.</p>

					<p><strong>In my <a title="utopia" href="http://flickr.com/photos/56425041@N00/404382099/">utopia</a>, I plan to provide everything for the people living there, with the option to expand; there will never be involuntary unemployment, the crime rate will be minimal, and the residents will generally be in the same socioeconomic class.</strong></p>
<p>The houses in Amical are all in one general area, so that the residents will be able to get to know each other  and be able to help each other out easily.  The houses are, however, spaced out just enough so that the families will be able get their privacy and not have to worry about the neighbors looking through their windows and stuff like that.  The same holds true with the factories and public buildings; they are all grouped together with others like it.  Where people live, work, and hang out are all in separate areas.  While at work, the workers won&#8217;t be able to look out the window and see the shops and start day dreaming.  In order for factory made goods to be readily available all the time, the productivity rate must be excellent.  So that is why the factories are pretty far away from the shops.  But if factory work isn&#8217;t for you, then there will always be jobs available at the shops.  The park is also nearby the shops so that you can get some quiet time in while running errands or if you just need to get away from everyday life.</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome, and we don&#8217;t discriminate.  Every house comes with the means to support the family living there: fields, orchards, woods, and easy access to the river.  I plan to end unemployment in the community by offering work to both men and women at the factory to the people working there.  If the factories were to become crowded, there is plenty of nearby land to build another one.  Any disturbances or breaking of the laws will be solved by the police department, which works with the judicial system.  Depending on who moves into the town, religion may or may not be a major component of our society.  The majority of the residents will also choose which religion to practice at the church.  We will have a governor, who is elected by the people, who will be in charge of the town.  The governor would also have a board of supervisors under him who will keep him in check while making decisions and passing laws.  We want a set up like that so our governor does not receive too much power, or aspire to gain total control.  The wealth will be distributed pretty evenly, since everyone has everything they need to live, and an equal chance of work at the factory.  Although the life style is not lavish, people will live contently and will never have to go without everyday necessities and comforts.  For instance, our people will never miss a meal because they either don&#8217;t have the means to make one or cannot afford one.  Drinking will also be strictly prohibited, which will be strongly enforced by the police department.  Hopefully, this will help increase morale and production rate, while lowering the crime rate.</p>
<p>My goal for this community will be to establish  an effective town in which people will have the freedom to provide for themselves, or choose to pay for the things that they need.  Alcoholism will not be a problem, so there would be no reason for alcohol to provide unproductive behavior.  Women&#8217;s rights will be honored with their equal opportunity to employment, if they choose to work.  I plan for Amical to be the ideal place to live, where everyone could live contently.</p>

					<p><strong>From 1828-1850, the Jacksonian Era defined the lifestyle in the United States, where unprecedented ventures and reform paved the way for the nation to transition from its current rural mentality into a more capitalistic, industrial, and urbanized way of life.</strong></p>
<p>A utopia would consist of both a religious and socialist community. Religious in the sense that since people were becoming more religious, and not drinking and restricting sexual behavior, and Socialist in the sense that people were moving more towards industrialism and making money and economically succeeding. My utopia will be a commercial enterprise, because our main goal is to make alot of money to improve the standards of living and be better than everyone else. Yet, everyone does their share of equal work. The community supports itself by the majority of it being industrial, but there are still some agricultural, because the entire society has not transformed into industrial yet. Some are still holding on to their traditional agricultural roots and since we want the world to be perfect for each one of our citizens, we understand that about them. Our utopia will also be open to the rest of the world, because our main goal is business and richness so the more people there are that come into our world, the more money we will be makng. It will be urban in character yet there will be no slavery. It will be a little bit of both worlds because we are in transition period when people are going from rural to urban, so our main goal is to satisfy both sides.</p>
<p>Our utopia is also a profit seeking capitalist community that also holds religion in high regards. Our religious faith was has not been forgotten even though money has become our number one priority. For our religious rules; there are restrictions on sexual behavior and drinking, and this will be implemented by everyone. It is a close-knit community and everyone keeps an eye on everyone. All people work equally and have equal and set standards. In essence, everyone will work for their fair share and accumulate all their money in one place and distrubute it evenly amongst everyone.</p>
<p>A Board of Directors is technically the head of the town. They don’t rule over anyone but they meet once a week to hear and set any problems straight. They are who the town people go to incase of emergencies, they know everything that is happening. All members of the community meet once a week in any public building and work together or talk. The way it is set out on the map is, the farms and the people that still farm are set on one side of the river. They don’t think the same way the people who have moved to an industrial way of living think and live their life the way they want to but still would rather be in our utopia. They have their farms and their homes. On the other side of the river is the new “city life” way of living. The factories are set all over the place and homes are all around so that people could live close to where they work. There are parks for families to enjoy their time and publc buildings for the citizens of our utopia to have their needs met just incase they are not.</p>

					<p>We hold these truths…<br />
We hold that a moral revival in these United States is possible without Puritanism; that is, without busybodies meddling into our personal affairs, without thought police controlling our intellectual life. We can attain a recommitment to moral values – without puritanical excesses…<br />
We hold that law and order can be restored without turning this country of the free into a police state, as long as we grant public authorities some carefully crafted and circumscribed new powers…<br />
We hold that the family – without which no society has ever survived, let alone flourished – can be saved, without forcing women to stay at home or otherwise violating their rights…<br />
We hold that schools can provide essential moral education – without indoctrinating young people…<br />
We hold that people can live in communities without turning to vigilantes or becoming hostile to one another…<br />
We hold that the pursuit of self-interest can be balanced by a commitment to the community, without requiring us to lead a life of austerity, altruism, or self-sacrifice….<br />
We hold that political officials can be civil and productive, while having different opinions, and still pursue the best interest of the entire community…<br />
We hold that powerful special-interest groups in the nation’s capital, and in so many statehouses and city halls, can be curbed without limiting the constitutional right of the people to lobby and petition those who govern….<br />
We hold these truths as affinitians, as people committed to creating a new moral, social, and public order based on restored communities, without Puritanism or oppression.<br />
The Jacksonian Era was a very influential time in the history of the United States. Expanded suffrage, manifest destiny, and patronage are just a few of the key changes in the nation. However, the political landscape continued to follow the same path of partisanship. <strong>Party politics and sectionalism were the predominant problems of the era.</strong> My utopian society, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67904202@N00/396864140/">Affinity</a>, is structured to correct the problems associated with the individualistic nature of the previous era.<br />
Since the formation of the Unites States, the resistance between political groups can be identified in each era. Jacksonian democracy was resisted by the Whig party. A major problem during Andrew Jackson’s presidency was the Nullification Crisis. It arose because of sectional differences concerning the Tariff of 1828. “Every state had numerous political factions, but they did not cross state lines.” The United States has consistently faced problems, because different factions try to pursue their own agenda, in the name of nation at large. If every citizen had more of a community-oriented mindset, it would eliminate many of the conflicts associated with individualism.<br />
The edict written above is the cornerstone of my utopian society, Affinity. A nation grounded in these principles has an opportunity to achieve a better sense of unity and community values. Given that the constitution of the Unites States was written in 1787, dilemmas arise because it is relevant for modern times. In Affinity, the edict is shaped for the present era, but is updated by new generations to represent the entire community’s values. Since the members of Affinity share the same core beliefs, this task will not be difficult. Despite being community oriented, individualism is highly encouraged. Having community values while promoting individualism seems like a paradox, however if citizens have their own ambitions and desires while adhering to what is best for the community, it is possible. Having an entire community believe the same core values may seem impractical, but it is how most nations are. The United States does not demand that all the citizens believe in the same basic values, but still most citizens share the same common beliefs: the Bill of Rights lays out most of the beliefs. Affinity will endeavor to do the same.<br />
Geographically, Affinity is designed around a square with Public Buildings in the middle, and Housing and Farming on the outside. Each member of the community has separate plots of land, equally spaced apart. There is farming land, for people to grow crops, and there are factories for other people to work at. The community is primarily capitalist based, but individuals are allowed, based on the edict of the community, to follow more traditional subsistence based living methods. Every citizen has the possibility of achieving their wishes, as long as they believe in the edict of the community. Politicians are very similar to modern times and the Jacksonian Era, although there are no political parties. They can have different ideas on how to serve the community, but instead of pursuing their own agenda, they work together to better serve the community. Affinity is a community shaped very similar to the United States today. The difference is there are clearly defined values and morals that the citizens believe and accept, as condition to live there. By doing what is best for the community, everybody is able to live in a realistic utopia.<br />

					<p>In my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/14675687@N00/399097413/">community</a> , the resident ranges from newborns to the elderly. Anyone is welcome as long as they can accept the rules. Who isn’t allowed in our community are trouble makers and anyone who cannot accept our rules. Our community as a whole is very trusting and caring. Since the population is only 3,000, everyone knows how everyone is and during special events, we all get together to play games and socialize. The layout of my community is very simple and spacious. The brick houses where the residents live are usually grouped together so no one is living by their self alone unless you are the mayor (which is elected by the people of my community) of the community which needs to be separated from everyone else so they can oversee and protect the whole community. Near the homes of the residents are farmlands so they can plant their own vegetables and fruits so they can eat and sell it to the market. Near the farmland are the orchards for clean air and fresh fruits and nuts.  The public building and the park is walking distance so you don’t have to drive to get there even there are roads to get there. On the other side of the river are the woods and the factory mill. You can tell that no one lives there. What is great about this community is that everyone is very hard working therefore, no one is homeless. Everyone is well to do. <strong>There will always be problems within a community such as drinking, sexual behaviors, and complex marriages therefore, we will have to work together to prevent this from happening.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>In order to have a safe and trusting community, we must work together. From my point of view, the residents in my community are always working together when there’s a serious problem going on. Problems such as drinking, sexual behaviors, and complex marriages which are mention on this <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/exploring/19thcentury/simutopia/index.php">link</a>. These problems that are happening in my community is very devastating because not is it only hurting us individually, but it is hurting us as a whole community.</p>
<p>The goal for my community is to solve our most serious problems which are drinking, sexual behaviors, and complex marriages. The reason for solving these serious issues is so that future generations won’t be exposed to these serious issues. These serious issues are damaging and will tear this wonderful community apart. Without the exposure to these serious issues, everyone in the community will be safer and there will not be a lot of kids in the orphanages. In conclusion, these problems and issues need to be solved because it will tear up this community</p>

					<p>So i was reading this <a title="article" href="http://www.myfoxdc.com/myfox/pages/News/Detail?contentId=2381662&amp;version=1&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=TSTY&amp;pageId=3.1.1">article</a> and became very upset and thought I would blog about it.  Now Bush is saying that Iran is supplying all of these weapons to Iraq. I have been calling this for along time. Ever since Bush decieded to talk about the &#8220;Axis of Evil&#8221; (which consists of Iraq, Iran, and North Korea), I have been awaiting the day he brings the next country into the war plans. He has been looking for different ways to anger the people into wanting to attack Iran and now he finally came up with one. Who cares that it is not proven that Iran&#8217;s government is the one providing these weapons?&#8221;I&#8217;m going to do something about it,&#8221; Bush pledged, displaying apparent irritation at being repeatedly asked about mixed administration signals on who was behind the weaponry.</p>
<p>This quote angers me the most. Who cares if the American people want to get involved? No its up to Bush, and Bush alone to decide that. I can only say that I am thankful that the executive branch and the legislative branch are now majority two different political parties. I am also thankful that he is nearing the end of his regime, it is time to get a sane person back in the White House before our foreign relations are damaged beyond repair.</p>

				<h2><a href="/courses/history120/spring07/the-boston-massacre.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to The Boston Massacre">The Boston Massacre</a></h2>
				<small>February 13th, 2007 <!-- by cpaulson --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><strong>While looking at the module depicting an image of the Boston Massacre, it is clear to see the bias shown against the British, and that the physical state of the British and Americans were very different.</strong> The module paints a clear picture for us to visualize the Boston Massacre itself, with such details as where people standing and what it is they are doing. You can see that Captain Preston, the British commander, is standing behind all of his men cheering them on, but not actually fighting himself, or standing in the line of danger. His troops are in a line infront of him all firing their guns at the Americans. The crowd itself is not nearly as organized as the British troops are, in both appearance and actions. They appear to be unarmed, nor are they fighting back, but tending to ones already shot by the British troops. It seems to be early evening, as you can see a small cresent moon in the upper left-hand corner.</p>
<p>One problem with the history of certain events, is that they most often are told from a specific view point, and are therefore biased in some way, shape, or form. By looking at this particular module, it seems Revere wants his viewers to interpret the Boston Massacre as the British making a surprise attack on unarmed Americans, and blatantly making the British out to be the bad guys. With that being said, Revere has also made the American&#8217;s appear disorganized by depicting them as a giant mob of people, instead of the organized line the British are standing in. To take it one step further, one could say that this particular group of American&#8217;s in Boston are not very patriotic because they do not appear to be actively fighting for their independence from Britain. Because Revere has created this picture, he obviously had a specific story he wanted to tell. Depending on wether it was a British or an American, others may tell the story a completely different way. </p>
<p>Although this module does tell a particular story from a particular point of view, that doesn&#8217;t mean that it is not credible. It is simply a portrayal of a part of history, which could very well be accurate. With so many different things going on in the picture, there are many ways to interpret what Revere is trying to depict, some being more obvious than others.</p>

<p><strong>The use of images can be helpful in understanding history because it gives you an actual look at what happened during the event that is being depicted, however you must be careful with images because they may be a biased look at the event.</strong> The <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/exploring/18thcentury/bostonmassacre/assignment.php">picture</a> by Paul Revere showing the Boston Massacre shows the side of the American people involved in the incident. Before describing what the picture shows, we must understand what actually happened in the Boston Massacre. A barbers apprentice was yelling at a British soldier because he thought that the soldier had not paid his bill. The soldier had in fact paid it but paid no attention to the boy. The boy continued to yell at the soldier so the soldier clubbed him. This act wound up creating a large mob of angry Americans who through things at the soldiers. The soldiers then called in for reinforcements. A chunk of ice hit one of the soldiers and knocked him on the ground and he fired into the air as he fell. Apparently, someone had yelled &#8220;fire.&#8221; This led to the rest of the troops firing into the crowd (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_massacre">wikipedia</a>). In the picture, Captian Preston is behind a line of troops with his sword raised ordering them to fire into the crowd of Americans. It seems to be depicting a hateful and uncalled for act by the Captian. In reality, one of the soldiers that was trying to keep the mob at bay. The troops are shown right next to the mob of Americans viciously gunning them down. There are huge clouds of smoke in the picture due to all the gunfire. The American crowd is larger than that of the British soldiers and is shown as completely innocent and scared. They seem to be cowering, trying to help the injured, and three dead mean on the ground.</p>
<p>This picture is being used to show the Americans being completely massacred, hence the name of the event, for no apparent reason. Revere must have wanted this picture to horrify Americans because he made some changes in the picture. First of all, he changed the name of the building behind the soldiers from Customs House to Butcher&#8217;s Hall. This makes the British seem like they are killing the Americans for no good reason. Secondly, the Americans are no retaliating what so ever and look completely innocent. Now nothing that I read says the Americans retaliated when the British started shooting, but they definitely were not being peaceful prior to the shots being fired. It seems Revere just wanted Americans to see this event as an innocent group of Americans were just walking around town and then some soldiers came and shot at them for no good reason. The British may not have been just in their actions, but it was not them just shooting Americans for no reason.</p>

					<p><strong>Images can be very useful for historians to determine one side&#8217;s feelings towards an event in history.</strong> For example, <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/exploring/18thcentury/bostonmassacre/assignment.php">this picture</a>, by Paul Revere, of the Boston Massacre portrays the American&#8217;s view of what happened there. The British commander is standing behind his troops giving them the orders almost as if he is unwilling to do any of the dirty work himself. The British troops are in front of a building with a sign that reads &#8220;Butchers House&#8221; on it suggesting that they are &#8220;butchering&#8221; the Americans. The American&#8217;s in this picture out number the British about 2-1. However the Americans are not fighting back against the British. Also the fight is happening in the middle of a street, in front of a church, at night. This helps to portray the British as evil since its in front of a church, and at night.</p>
<p>Paul Revere uses this picture to depict the British as evil, and probably to help gain support from the colonists for the revolution. The British are firing on people that are completely defenseless, that show no signs of instigation, and who are not fighting back. Revere even changes the name of the building they are in front of from custom house to Butchers house. The leader of the British troops is standing there calling out orders to his men, encouraging them to continue to add to the violence. All of this adds to the idea that Revere wanted this to appear as brutal, and as uncalled for as possible. Pictures such as this suggest that revolutionary leaders were very creative in their attempts to gain support for their cause. It also serves to illustrate one potential view of this event. The reason that there may be several different accounts of an event like this is because people tend to exaggerate stories to make actions resulting from it seem more justified. Phenomena like this can help historians to begin to realize how stories can spread and create more support for actions, and how historical events can be altered to show one side more negatively then the other.</p>

				<small>February 6th, 2007 <!-- by hjathoul --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><strong>    Mulatto slaves had very useful skills and were considered exceptionally valuable.</strong> The chances of escape as a Mulatto Slave where enhanced due to his or her color. As a Mulatto slave, chances of escape where increased since the skin color resembled that of Native Americans. As explained in many advertisements resembling Indians as appose to African American slaves made chances of escape much greater. As many Mulatto slaves disguised themselves as Indians wearing match coats and other Indian apparel, increasing their chances of escape and hiding out amongst Black Indians. Many where found hiding in forests and other wooded areas as they attempted to pass themselves off as Black Indians. It appears that the runaways had to be witty and cunning to portray themselves as freed slaves or a Black Indians.</p>
<p>These ads tell us a great deal about the courage and resilience these men and women had during these times of hardship. Some advertisements had warnings explaining how difficult it was to catch certain slaves. Many would escape again from the slave trackers or would not allow themselves to surrender or be taken alive. These advertisements help show us the mentality and courage of the runways. It took a strong willed person to run-a-way from is his or her master, as these slaves did not know what was waiting for them on the road to freedom. Many Mulatto slaves had acquired skills which were vital to plantations such as carpentry, farming, taming horses, and medicine. Some owners where willing to pay up to two hundred dollars for the return of their runaway slave. At that time that amount of money would equal big bucks today. It is clear that in having such skills as carpentry or horse taming a lot of these slaves could be earning good money as freed slaves.</p>
<p>In most advertisements it seems as if the slave owners are showcasing the talents of the runaway slaves. The way certain texts are written makes it appear as if the slaves made a bad choice and just needed to find there way back to the plantation. They disguise the fact that a human is owned by another human. The Mulatto slaves had a better chance of escape due to their mixed color and their ability to take advantage of that. This history lesson shows us that when people are treated unjustly, they will find ways to rise above it.</p>

					<p>After looking at different advertisement for runaway slaves I learned something different about slaves.  <strong>In each article the slaves were called English servant man or woman rather than slaves or Negro’s and the owners knew them really well physically and their personality.  </strong>Another point the advertisements make is that the slaves use different methods to hide themselves so they can’t be found for example in the article on October 24<sup>th</sup> 1745 <a href="http://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/gos/search/relatedAd.php?adFile=sg45.xml&amp;adId=v1745101395">James Gibson</a> who ran away lied to everyone who he came across and as noted by the owner as a cunning fellow.  Another example of this was printed on November 11<sup>th</sup> 1747 where <a href="http://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/gos/search/relatedAd.php?adFile=md1747.xml&amp;adId=m1747110004">Margaret Barnes</a> who ran away and claims to everyone that she could predict fortunes for others.  The articles that I read did not state what skills the servants possessed and the reason behind that is that the owners did not what to alert others with the skills their servant’s possessed. This might be a problem in the process of getting them back since the servants will do what they do best in to earn a living while away from their masters.<br />
In the last article that I read was the one where <a href="http://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/gos/search/relatedAd.php?adFile=sg45.xml&amp;adId=v1745041377">John Owl</a> ran away from his master and the interesting part on the advertisement was that he ran away last on February 14<sup>th</sup>.  This tells a lot about Mr. Owl who ran away more than once but was found and returned in the previous incidents.  All the articles were very through with the different clothing that they wore right before fleeing off and also different kinds of scars or any other physical appearance that would identify them.  The advertisements did a lot of great thing describing the servants.<br />
Slaves are all kept against their will as said in the wikipedia article of slavery “Slaves are people who are held against their will since either their capture, their purchase, or their birth, and are deprived of their individual freedom for the purpose of exploitation of their labour and in some cases their sexual abuse.” [1]  This tells us that they never had it easy with their masters so in return they ran away and never returned and if found they would try to find another way to escape  such as Mr. Owl who ran away a couple of times.<br />
All these advertisments shows us how much the owners miss their servants because of the output they gave to the owners such as farming, shoe maker and many more other things.  Inaddition the advertisments also pointed out that they were not called slaves but instead called servant man or woman and the amount of information that they owners knew about them.</p>

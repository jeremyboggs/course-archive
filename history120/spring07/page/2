<p><em>Memorials in our Nation’s Capitol: What makes them important?<br />
</em> </p>
<p>Each and everyday we go out and about to live our lives, we pass by buildings, memorials, and monuments.  Sometimes we admire their beauty, their size, and how they have been able to withstand the elements over the years.  Not only in the United States, but across the world, different memorials and monuments are created to symbolize people, events, or amazing creations from the creation of the world.  When creating buildings around the world each and every architect has different and unique ideas on how to develop them.  How can we differentiate why it was built that way?  <strong>What makes the piece special the way created and shown, and what is the specific meaning that the architect himself meant to put behind the piece?  </strong>We can look at several exhibits in our own nation’s capital of Washington D.C., for clues and insight on key attributes. </p>
<p>One of the most obvious and most noted monuments in the nation’s capital is that of the Washington Monument.  It is the tallest monument because to represent our place in society and the world, we keep ourselves at a high standard and high expectations and high level of success.  It is also visible from citizens as well as travelers when entering the nation’s capitol in an airplane.  The monument is also recognized for our first president, George Washington, and how he started the roots of our great country.  George Washington not only being the first president started the path for the US, which has an unlimited room for growth, as it points to the sky.  The monument also symbolizes how high we’ve made our way in society in such a short time.  The monument can also be found on George Washington’s $1.00 bill.  The top portion of the obelisk has an illuminated eye, which I feel symbolizes that someone is always there to watch you.  The United States is a country that is very diverse and open to people of all races and cultures.  No matter where you are, the monument is high enough and is there to guide you and watch over your shoulder.  The Washington Monument continues to serve as one of the most popular attractions in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>Much like the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, created for the remembrance and life/work of Abraham Lincoln.  This building was created with the authentic Greek style, found in Greece.  This Greeks were known for democracy, and if anyone, it was Abraham Lincoln who defended democracy during the civil war and by succeeding in the war.  He essentially “saved” our democracy and by doing such, they made a vast memorial using Greek architecture.  Not only did Abraham Lincoln help our country but the most noted Emancipation Proclamation is something he was also remembered for.  The ability to recognize and fight for different races and cultures, was also a reason for his great size inside the monument, sitting in a huge chair, arms and legs open and embracing everyone who entered.  This was a man who believed in doing good deeds everyday, and establishing a sense of unity and nationalism in our country.  The character and morals behind this great American president is a reason the monument was built with such detail and care.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Vietnam War Memorial is one emotional as well as intriguing memorial in our nation’s capitol.  It differs greatly in size and in comparison to the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial, but the size does not take away from its importance.  One reason why the wall was created was during the harsh times of the Vietnam War there was a “wall” between democracy and communism.  People fought to break down that wall and let democracy win.  By making a wall they are basically saying that this was the barrier which the soldiers tried to break down. This was a barrier between democracy and communism, in order to spread communism.  There were many people opposed to the war, but the US continued.  The wall has names of those lives fallen, and the names of people who died trying to support our democracy at home.  Lastly, the most ironic thing about the memorial is that of the reflection from the black marble which it is made of.  We can see ourselves in the reflection of the memorial, which should be to look at ourselves, to not make the same mistakes as those made in the past, and remember to do good deeds and why we are here in the first place.  We should serve our country as those names on the memorial did so valiantly.</p>
<p>As we look and compare all of the monuments and memorials, one thing is common about all of them.  They were created for us as citizens, visitors, and human beings to understand the importance of actions that instilled the creation of the memorial.  From president’s actions to wars, we should all learn an important lesson, life is too short to be close minded.  We must open up, and have a sense of nationalism, and support our respective country that we live in with our full heart.  Even one person can change the course of history, which is very susceptible to change.  Who knows, in the future a memorial might be created to honor acts of a family, person, or even me.</p>

					<p>Monuments are built in order to remember us of events, people and places.  <strong>Monuments are historical, which remind us of our past and how we got to today’s world.</strong>  For example the Washington monument which is the tallest building in Washington DC, the peaceful World War II monument and the huge Lincoln monument.  Each of these monuments represents some part of history that we passed and has a story linked behind it.  I choose these three the Washington, Lincoln and the World War II monument to write about because they have some similarities and differences.  They are similar in the way they are positioned because when you stand on one end of the mall you can see all three of them in one straight line and different because they are represent different parts of history.</p>
<p>The Washington monument has a really interesting fact the most people would have never know of, which is that no building can be taller than the monument in the District of Columbia.  In regards to this matter a while ago the statue on top of the capital was taller than the monument so they trimmed the statue on the capital and made it smaller so it wasn’t taller than the Washington monument.  It also symbolizes that since Washington was the father of United States he got the tallest monument to represent what he did for our country.</p>
<p>The next monument I strolled through was the World War II memorial which was recently built in remembrance of the people who died while protecting the world, the two bombs that were dropped on Japan.  This monument represented peace and there was pin drop silence while I was walking in and around it.  The reason behind this might be that since people would imagine the horrible things that went on during those times.  One really interesting fact that I noticed was that the water fountain that is in the middle has the shape of the smoke after the bombs were dropped in Japan.  The only thing that was missing was the mushroom head but all the other characteristics are the same. </p>
<p>The final monument that I visited was the Lincoln memorial and apart for it being in a straight line in reference to the other monuments, Lincoln did free all the slaves.  Even though I had no one in my family tree that was a slave in America but how every in my family tree my grand father was a slave in Kenya.  He was taken from India as a slave to build railroads by the British.  Getting back to the point, anyone who freed slaves took a huge step in improving humanity. </p>
<p>These monuments represent different things and have a lot of history behind it, whether the event was glorious or horrific.  Like the Washington monument everyone is enjoying, having a picnic, throwing the ball around and having fun in the grass area around it because it represents victory against the British.  However the World War II monument reminds everyone of the sad things that went on so everyone is quite and just enjoying the peaceful environment.  The Lincoln memorial was extremely noisy mainly because it is in an enclosed environment and the voices echoed around and out side people are sitting on the stairs and enjoying the view of the Washington monument’s reflection in the pool of water. </p>

				<h2><a href="/courses/history120/spring07/national-mall-photo-essay-a-monumental-use-for-water.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to National Mall Photo Essay: A Monumental Use for Water">National Mall Photo Essay: A Monumental Use for Water</a></h2>
				<small>May 8th, 2007 <!-- by tadao --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>     There are many aspects of memorials that contribute to how they commemorate historical figures or important events, and that reflect how our nation wishes to remember and present its history. These aspects, which include the architectural design and the materials they are made of, also have an impact on the way people interact with each other, and the way people interact with the monument. One aspect in particular, the element of water, is incorporated into the design of many memorials such as the National Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, and the National World War II Memorial. <strong>Water is used in various ways in memorials around the National Mall as a tool to help the United States present, remember, and commemorate its history.</strong></p>
<p>     Since I am a Japanese American, I decided to analyze the use of water in the National Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism, which was dedicated in November 2000 in honor of the Japanese Americans who fought and died for American ideals and freedom. The memorial also functions as a reminder of the Japanese families who were forced into internment camps, and acknowledges the failures to maintain liberty, freedom, and democracy in the United States. When at the memorial, a stagnant pool of water acts as the centerpiece and main attraction. The pool is shallow, and contains rocks as well as visible grooves on its floor that make the water look like a well kept Zen Garden. This resemblance of a Japanese Zen/Rock Garden, as well as the rocks that represent the islands of Japan and the generations of Japanese Americans, are symbols of Japanese heritage and culture in America. Another important feature of the pool is its stillness, which can be interpreted as a representation of the suffering and feeling of entrapment of those who were in internment camps. Also, with Zen being a Japanese school of Mahayana Buddhism that emphasizes meditation and intuition, the pool’s Zen garden theme helps promote peacefulness and quite reflection upon Japanese history in America. Being just a block north of the Capital Building, the Japanese American Memorial is in a busy part of town, but it is surprising how quiet it is in the memorial itself. Preoccupied by reading quotes and gazing into the Zen-like pool, visitors seemed not speak to each other, but if they did, it was in a manner too quite to be heard by others. The use of the water in order to achieve this quietness is a mechanism designed by the United States to present and remember the period of Japanese internment as a time of injustice and many mistakes. These feeling of remorse are further encouraged by a quote by President Reagan inscribed on the edge of the Zen pool which states, “Here we admit a wrong. Here we affirm our commitment as a nation to equal justice under the law. “. </p>
<p>     Another memorial in which water plays a significant role in presenting and remembering United States history is the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, which was dedicated to the memory of President Roosevelt and the era he represents. I chose this memorial because of the fact that water played a significant role in Roosevelt’s life. Roosevelt was an avid sailor having been born and raised on the edge of the Hudson River, and was at one point in his early political career the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. Thus, water is a very important symbolic component of his memorial. There are four areas or “rooms” that represent his four respective terms in office, each of which containing a waterfall. As one walks from room to room, each waterfall increases in complexity, which is symbolic to the increasing complexity of Roosevelt’s presidency that was marked by economic depression and world war. There are five water areas, the first of which is a waterfall that has a single large drop-off. This is symbolic of the crash of the economy that led to the great depression. The next is a series of stair-step waterfalls, which was designed to be symbolic of the Tennessee Valley Authority dam building project and the rebuilding of the economy. The third is a group of chaotic waterfalls that fall at varying angles, which is representative of World War II. Here, each waterfall can be looked at as a separate nation with its own unique motives that clash and/or combine with other nations. Ultimately all the waterfalls lead to the same body of water, which is symbolic of many nations in a worldwide war. The fourth body of water is a still reflecting pool that is accompanied by a bronze frieze or “Funeral Cortege” that was designed by Leonard Baskin. Both of which are representative of Roosevelt’s death. Baskin portrayed the effects of FDR’s death by saying, “The great bronze piece is mirrored in a reflecting pool, and just as the bronze depiction memorializes FDR’s death, the mirrored image in the pool symbolizes the profound reflective effect the president’s death had on the American people.”. Because the water is stagnant, this room is a much more quiet area than the others, creating a sense of peace and allowing people to reflect and pay tribute to the life and death of FDR.  Finally, the last water area is a combination of the four previous water areas, a retrospective of Roosevelt’s presidency. Each of these water areas clearly represents a major event in each of Roosevelt’s four terms, creating a historical timeline that can be used to teach or simply remember the time that was so important to United States history. </p>
<p>     The National World War II Memorial opened to the public in April 2004 in honor of all Americans who served in the armed forces and home front during World War II. Located on the eastern end of the reflecting pool, between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument, The World War II memorial is another monument in which water plays a significant role in portraying US history. In the center of the memorial, there is a Rainbow Pool, which is located in between two pavilions. One pavilion is inscribed with the word “Atlantic” and one inscribed with “Pacific”, each having a fountain at their base to represent the two major Theatres of battle. This is symbolic of how the war took place all around the world. Even more symbolism occurs in the center rainbow pool itself, where the circular fountains represent the free individuals of America, and the way that they come from the same pool symbolizes national unity. Furthermore, the architects of the WWII Memorial gave it a mostly light and celebratory feeling in order to reflect how the United States won the war. The Rainbow Pool and its unified fountains contribute to this celebratory atmosphere of the memorial, in that the fountains are similar in nature to fireworks. Also, In contrast to quiet memorials such as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, which is designed for grieving, the noise that the fountains emit gives a sense that visitors are allowed to talk freely. In contrast, there is a still pool of water that sits in front of the “Freedom Wall” containing the 4,048 gold stars that each representing approximately 100 American soldiers who died in the war. This still water is a mechanism to allow visitors to remember the fallen ones in a peaceful manner. Also, the water gives off a reflection of the stars, presenting a sense of greatness to the stars and those who they represent. Thus, the United States used water in the National World War II Memorial in order to remember the power of unified free people with a just cause, celebrate its victory, and to remember that war is never without sacrifice.  </p>
<p>     The element of water is not incorporated into all memorials, but in the ones that do, it is usually not arbitrary and has a specific purpose. This was seen in the National Japanese American Memorial where water was used to cherish Japanese heritage in America and promote peaceful reflection, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial where water was used to portray the events of Roosevelt’s presidency, and the National World War II Memorial where water was used to set different moods of environment. Even though its relevance is often overlooked, the use of water is undoubtedly a significant aspect in how memorials reflect the United States’ desires to remember and present its history. </p>

					<p>Most of us at one time or another have heard about the Westboro Baptist Church.They are the radical group that calls themselves a church who go to the funerals of dead servicemen and protest with signs that say &#8220;God Hates Fags&#8221; etc. The &#8220;church&#8221; recruits its members from one family, it is a family operation. So the question is, is it time that America take away the children of these radicals. They cause them to experience great hate without every getting a choice in how they feel. I understand the debate between freedom of speech and hate speech, but these kids have been brainwashed. The Westboro Baptist church are a cult which brainwashes children to believing nothing but intense hate. They claim that they are warriors for God, but does it really sound like a true argument. How many groups have claimed this. America has now begun to enact laws that the Westboro baptists church must stay a certain distance away from all military funerals. Some reactionary groups, such as the freedom riders, ride motorcycles to the funerals and use the loud sound of the engines to drown out the protests. The families of the victims have said that the sound of the motorcycles is music to their ears over the hate speech. The freedom riders are truly a great group. It is time that America do something to abolish these groups that spread nothing but hate. Social Services should have taken these kids a long time ago and put themo in a better environment than these &#8220;God Warriors&#8221;</p>

					<p>Washington D.C. Is America&#8217;s Capital. And because it is so, it is necessary that the city contain many honors to the great Americans who have shaped the country to become the great superpower that it has since our creation in 1776. <strong>Although they have created many memorials, such as statues, buildings, gardens, and fountains, the great monuments have much more symbolism than meets the eye.</strong></p>
<p><strong>         </strong>Lets begin at the Lincoln Memorial. What meets the eye is a sculpture of Abraham Lincoln. Simple Enough. But lets examine further. Look at his expression of his face. Stern and serious. Considering that Lincoln was a very serious man who endured much pain in his life, this seems fitting. THe lighting used creates an ominous view of the former President as if he was almost to be worshipped. The words behind him describe what kind of a President he was, while the giant panels of words to his left and right are words spoken by him. Although delivered over 100 years ago, Americans this day are supposed to view the words as symbols of a great America and live by these words and use them as a guide to live. Now, look at where Lincoln views from his seat. By looking out from his area, you can see the rest of the monuments out through the pillars. Just like he saw over the country when he served as president, the architects of the monument made sure he can still watch over the country today in symbol.</p>
<p>        Next up was the World War II memorial. The World War II memorial was by far the most complicated memorial we saw. Look at the way it is designed. Pillars, fountains, wreaths. There are more parts to this memorial than any other. And why shouldn&#8217;t there be. More people, not just Americans, were affected by World War II. Because of the amount of people affected, not just a single American, it is most fitting to be able to reflect as accurately as possible. Each pillar represents a state, such as Iowa, Utah, etc. The wreath placed on each states pillar represents an honor to the dead from each state. However, the states are not the only ones honored. America&#8217;s dependents, such as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, also have pillars. The dead of Europe are also honored with pools to reflect upon their dead, although they are not Americans.</p>
<p>      Lastly, there is the Washington Monument, the most famous of all monuments. Across from the reflecting pool, a long pool which can reflect the entire Washington Monument, and the lighting ensures that it is reflected at any time. This is a spot that was popular for protests because it is a place where Americans are supposed to go to reflect on their own lives and duties of Americans. Some like what they see, some do not. Then comes the tall white structure. Although it does not serve any type of true purpose, it is still extremely symbolic. One symbol that I believe I found is the uniform design. Every side is the same, smooth, simple, no decorations. I believe this is because all accounts of Washington as a man was simple and consistent, much like the monuments design. The Washington monument is also, by rule, the tallest structure in D.C., because Washington is the most important figure in our history. Also surrounding the monument are 50 American Flags, one for each state in the country, none of which would exist without George Washington.</p>
<p>      All these monuments are so full of symbols that most people do not realize. The architects and planners clearly had an idea that often go unnoticed. The National Mall is a great spot to go to explore symbols in American structure to honor our greatest heroes. Hopefully, this small essay did something to help open your eyes to the symbols you may have not noticed before when you visit the National monuments of Lincoln, Washington, and World War 2.</p>

					<p>                Growing up in the DC area, most of us don’t appreciate all the resources we have in our backyard.  DC is known for being a historic place where the history of our country was made. Every corner has a memorial and to the younger generation, some may think of it as “boring”. But to tourists from around the world it is a place to remember. <strong>A memorial is designed to preserve a memory of a person or event; it keeps the memories of the past alive for today. </strong>I visited three memorials that I thought were a symbol of our past and significant for the future. I chose the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, The Korean War Memorial and the World War II Memorial.         </p>
<p>                The first memorial I visited was the Vietnams Veterans Memorial. The Vietnam memorial is consists of three parts, the wall, the soldier’s statue and the woman’s memorial.  The most well-known is the wall with all the names of the 58,256 names that have now recently included woman. One thing that I noticed when I was there were little symbols around all the names. I found out that those symbols have meaning to each one. The missing is denoted with a cross; the confirmed dead are marked with a diamond. If the missing return alive, the cross is circumscribed by a circle, and if their death is confirmed, a diamond is superimposed over the cross. The vast amount of names show how many people died in that war and by the style of the memorial, the larger part towards the middle has an impact when you reach it. There was a newer part to the memorial called The Three Soldiers that created some controversy. It consisted of a White American, Black American and a Hispanic. They were deigned to look over at the wall from a distance but not be a part of the wall but and addition.<br />
                The second memorial that was along the way was the Korean War Memorial. The style of this memorial is a open triangle with 19 soldiers including, 15 Army, 2 Marines, 1 Navy Corpsman, and 1 Air Force Forward Air Observer. If you look closely at each of statues facial expression, they are all unique and show the emotion one could have felt being in that war. Looking at the memorial you could see the Asian influence with the juniper bushes at there feet to show the harsh conditions the soldiers were faced with. There was also a wall similar to the Vietnam wall, but very different. It was made of granite, so when you looked at the murals you could also see your reflection. At the very end of the memorial near the tip of the triangle there was a peaceful fountain, The Pool of Remembrance.  It has inscriptions of the numbers killed, wounded, missing in action, and held as prisoners of war. Near that pool engraved in a granite wall, is the message “Freedom Is Not Free”, which has a great impact when you first read it.<br />
                The last memorial that I saw was the newest, The World War II Memorial. It was open in 2004 to the public and dedicated to President George W. Bush. The monument consists of 56 pillars the have the names of the states, districts, and territories that surround the fountain in the middle. There are two arches at the ends of the memorial, Atlantic and Pacific. On the outsides of the memorial you can find carving of scenes from the war, you can also find quotes from presidents all around the walls. There was some controversy about the memorial when it was first built. In the past the area that the memorial was built upon was used for protests and demonstrations. The National Coalition to Save Our Mall opposed the design and the location of the memorial because of the location in-between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial.<br />
                Even though there were controversies with all three memorials I think that if it was not there some in the future may not remember the past. With the impact of the statues and all the names on a wall some can connect with the memorials in a different way then they could with a textbook. We learn from the past to have a better future and what better way to remember the past with memorials.</p>

					<p>As a kid growing up, the only inkling I have of any religious activity was when the family got together for holiday lunches and dinners and said grace before we ate. I never went to church, temple, synagouge or any places of worship really, but the times that I did, I was rather uncomfortable in the situation. Earlier on I believed that there was a god, and that whoever or wherever he was, he was looking out for me. As I began to get older and start to discover what religions held what characteristics, it seemed more to me that everyone of them had their own opinions and ideals, and if you didn&#8217;t agree with it you were going to hell. That was just a little bit absurd to me so I began to stray away from the thoughts of God. I began to debate if Religion was something created by man, to instill an undeniable fear in those that believed in it, in turn creating a way of control over a faction of people. It wasn&#8217;t for a while that I finally came to graps with how I actually feel. I believe that there is an actual God out there, I do not believe in Heaven and Hell, but rebirth of the soul. <strong>Religion is something that is a personal thought, something that if you believe in hard enough and you practice what you preach, then you are okay and you aren&#8217;t going to go to hell.</strong><br />
The stories of each religion are presented in a plethora of different ways, with different gods, different saviors, different bibles, and different beliefs, but it seems that all are working towards a unified goal, usually one of salvation or enlightenment. With so many options, how would one that had no previous religious knowledge know which to believe and which would actually lead them to their ultimate goal? How do we even know that what we are preaching is truly going to lead us to salvation, and that it wasn&#8217;t all just made up by some guy reading a special stone in his special decoder HAT!?</p>
<p>A real life example was recently by the Clock Tower of the JC. There is a gentleman that is constantly there that preaches his faith, not sure which one, but he sits there screaming off passages out of his bible. Who is he to say what he believes in is the correct faith. He even directed a statement towards me asking me if I had &#8220;accepted Jesus Christ as my Savior.&#8221; When I told him that I believe that there is a god out there that looks over all of us, he exclaimed that I was going to hell. My automatic recriprocation to his thought was, &#8220;Is anyone that doesn&#8217;t agree with you and your version of the bible, essientially going to hell?&#8221; His answer was a Stern &#8220;Yes, but I can still save myself, by accepting Jesus Christ in to my life and calling him my savior. It was at this point that I did not was to start a holy war and walked away.</p>
<p>I actually ended up going home and as much as I didn&#8217;t want to think about it, I kept replaying the situation in my head, over and over again. It was a few days later, that I finally came up with a paradox to his statement so to speak. If I recall correctly, A person who claims to be Aethist, is a person that does not believe in God, heaven, hell, or any of the usual religious proceedings. They believe that once a person dies, his body and flesh is recycle in to the earth, just like any other living thing. So technically here he would be wrong as of so far because while he is taught that Jesus Christ is his savior and Jesus will save anyone that belives in him. Well if Aethists dont believe in heaven or hell, then even if they dont accept Jesus Christ as their savior, where exactly is it that they go when they die? Can&#8217;t be heaven or hell because those two technically don&#8217;t exist in that persons mind or faith.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m ultimately trying to get at here is not debunking religion. I just believe that Religion has taken a stray road from what it may have originally been. Now a days its all about spreading your faith to those that do not know it, in order to convert them to your way of thinking. I&#8217;ve heard of stuff like that before, but it was rather difficult to understand because it was in GERMAN! It seems that Churches are now one of the biggest &#8216;business&#8217; schemes on the planet. Have you ever seen how lavish some of the churches that are being constructed these days are? I&#8217;m sure that god listens to the poor just as much as he does the rich, so what is the use of having golden angel fountains that spit water in to a pool? Does that allow the practitioners of that lavish church more liberties than those of less fortunate churches? If you have a strong belief if your own faith, than it shouldn&#8217;t matter if everyone else around you believes in it too. If you can&#8217;t see that than you might not be as faithful as you think.</p>
<p>This post was not meant to offend anyone or make fun of any religions, yet it is a touchy topic, so feel free to go rampant with comments. While I do not necessairly have a designated faith, I was raised under a Buddihst ideal by my father and mother. Personally, I am not a practicing buddhist, nor do I adhere to all of the paths to enlightenment that are set forth, yet. I do however try to instill some of the views and teachings in my everyday life. I believe in the teachings of reincarnation of the soul in multiple forms, let it be person, animal or and living species and that every living object has a soul. I don&#8217;t believe in killing anything unless it is for survival, let it be for food or protection. You never know if that hamburger you are eating was your uncle who may have passes away years before. Lastly,  Karma, it plays a huge role in our lives and screams that old saying &#8220;Do unto others, as you would like done unto you.&#8221;</p>

					<p>Though all of the memorials at the National Mall are built in their own, very special and different way, there are themes that can tie each monument together. <strong>At the World War II Memorial, the George Washington Monument, and the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, each monument had a completely different look, but one idea tied them all together: the idea of how atmosphere and water play into one&#8217;s overall experience at the memorials</strong>. All three monuments had very different atmospheres and the mood surrounding the memorials was varried from each memorial. Not only did the way the memorials were built effect this overall atmosphere, but the way people acted around each of the monuments, as well as the role that water played at the monument, effected the experience one would have when visiting the National Mall. </p>
<p>The first memorial I visited was the World War II Memorial. Just by walking up from where I parked my car, I could see how great the memorial is just by its pure size. It is huge! However, most people did not seemd fazed by how large this memorial was, but seemed to flock near to where the numorous water features were. When you approach the memorial, you can hear the roaring of water fountains from a good distance away. This made the already bustling atmosphere (due to the large groups of people standing everywhere) even more chaotic by adding this loud sound of water. People did not seem to want to stop their conversations to take a look around and pay attention to the massive amounts of detail that were clearly put into this memorial, for example, the name of every state being engraved into a smaller pillar surrounding the memorial itself. The overall lighthearted feeling could have been due to the gorgeous weather on this particular day, but I do not think so. If one looked closely at the fountains, you could see that thousands of pennies had been thrown into the water over the years. The idea of throwing a penny into the water symbolizes making a wish, a task people usually take on when they are in a happy, more spirited mood, which could only be contributed to by the atmosphere at the World War II Memorial.</p>
<p>The second memorial I visited was the George Washington Monument, with its Reflecting Pool. The atmosphere here starkly contrasted the overall feeling one gathered from the World War II Memorial. Although there were large, loud crowds of people standing near the streets and behind the relecting pool, there were few people standing right next the the reflecting pool, and the ones that were, did not seem to make much noise. The water involved in this memorial was also very different to that of the first memorial I visited. There were no flowing fountains creating noise, in fact, there was no extravegance at all, only a long, rectangular, still pool of water. One thing that really struck me about this memorial was the Reflecting Pool itself. When you stand completely centered across from the monument itself, you see its entire reflection in the pool, and it honestly is quite a site. It makes this already huge monument seem twice as tall. I do not know if people were shy due to the pure height of the monument, or if the still water had a calming effect on the people at the memorial there that day, but the atmosphere was much more quiet and subdued than the first memorial I visited.</p>
<p>The third and final memorial I visited was the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial. This memorial was by far the quietest regarding people making noise, but was also the loudest in terms of water. As soon as you walk into the memorial, you see the first waterfall of many. Although by itself it is a rather demure waterfall, combind with the other waterfalls, the overall effect is a great one. This memorial is also built very differently than the others, in that it is more of a maze shape, and you more proactive in experiencing the memorial, much more so than the George Washington Monument, or the World War II Memorial for that matter. Most of the engravings on the walls and the waterfalls themselves are on almost the same level as you are, making the experience much more intimate. There were few people evn walking around the FDR Memorial that day, which makes me question whether or not I got an accurate feel on what people act like at this memorial, but from what I was able to observe, people were very quiet, barely speaking to eachother. There is a picture in my photo essay of several statue men standing in a row, that at the time I did not realize represented people during the Great Depression, but once I researched it more, it all seemed to make sense. Their glum faces and shabby clothing were very symbolic of the times during the period that FDR was president. The waterfalls also seemed to capture the idea of that time as well, in their small and understated stature, there was nothing overly flashy or intimidating about this memorial, but much more like something people can actually relate to. </p>
<p>Overall, my experience at the National Mall was an excellent one. I had never really been there for a school project, and clearly needing to pay attention to small details made the experience that much different. I had never really stopped to think about the atmosphere surround the memorials before, including that of how people were acting in certain areas, or the role that water played in each of the memorials. I chose these specific memorials because they all used water in their overall design, and I wanted to see how that effected the mood that surround the memorial. As a general rule, I observed that when the water was avtive and loud, so were the people, and visa versa. The way people acted coincided with the way the water behaved more so than I had ever noticed before, and it truly did bring an entire new perspective to the National Mall.</p>

					<p>If you were to hear &#8220;New World Order,&#8221; its likely that you would think of one of two things. One possibility would be a very trashy t-shirt with the face of some ogre sized, anabolic steroid using, &#8216;professional&#8217; wrestler. This article of clothing, I use that term loosely, usually adorns a person who believes that wrestling is truly REAL! On the other hand if you are anything like myself, which I know many of you are, you would probably think of something with a bit of sustenance, something like a huge conspiracy theory that has possibly taken over our government and way of thinking. NEW WORLD ORDER and the super secret Freemasons, Illuminated Ones, Knights Templar. . . you know stuff that we dabble in a tad bit in courses but don&#8217;t get to really get in to the psychotic nitty gritty of.<strong> The symbolism and aesthetics throughout Washington DC were designed upon principles and beliefs tied deeply in Freemasonry, but the overall layout, intentional or not,  does indeed contain a bulk of occult imagery.</strong></p>
<p>It is undeniable that the Masonic Compass and Square are prevalent in a map of our nations capital. Illustrated by this <a title="map" href="http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/False%20Religions/Illuminati/satan_dc.png">map</a>, we can easily see that that White House, U.S. Capitol, Washington Monument, Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials make up what is a to scale rendition of the Masonic Compass and square seen <a title="here." href="http://cura.free.fr/xxv/22ed3.gif">here</a>. This could be easily associated to the fact that many of our founding fathers were part of the Freemasons and they possibly wanted to leave their mark on what they built. That still leaves the also obvious pentagram extending North of the White House and many other satanic aspects of the design unexplained.</p>
<p>There is large speculation that the planners of Washington DC used &#8216;templates&#8217; to model the capital city that they were building. These templates being, <a title="The Kabbalistic Tree of Life" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Tree_of_life_wk_02.jpg">The Kabbalistic Tree of Life</a>, <a title="Metatron's Cube," href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ee/Metatrons_cube.svg">Metatron&#8217;s Cube</a>, and <a title="The Great Pyramid Cross Section" href="http://www.book-of-thoth.com/thebook/images/thumb/600px-Fig_1.jpg">The Great Pyramid Cross Section</a>. These images overlayed with the map pose an interesting little debacle with all sorts of ties astrology and religion. All of the renditions, and more information can be found at <a href="http://www.startiming.net/cave/wdc-1.html">Famous (and no so famous) Pentagrams in Washington DC</a> and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/jussaymoe/dc_symbolism/">Masonic and Kabbalistic Symbols in the Washington DC map</a> . While there is a great deal of speculation to what is actually true and what is false, I&#8217;m going to stick to what I found at the monuments that make up the Masonic Square and Compass. Due to a freak puddle jumping accident a week prior of our journey, my co-conspiracy theorist / Human GPS / Photographer had broken his leg, obviously his walking abilities were impaired, so we only got to physically visit three of the five destinations. The Washinton Monument, The White House, and The Jefferson Memorial.</p>
<p>The Washington Monument lies directly West of the Capitol in a straight line with it and the four sides of the monument are aligned with the cardinal directions. While it was built in tribute of George Washington, The Father of Our Country, there is also underlying occult symbolisms within it&#8217;s praise. The height of the Washington Monument above ground, is 555.5 feet tall and 55.5 feet wide at its base. Here we see a 1:10 ratio, a common ratio found in obelisks built by the Egyptians, from whom the design may have been borrowed. The Ancient Egyptians considered the obelisk where the sun god&#8217;s spirit resided. If you read in depth one of those links you will recall the Ancient Egyptian Sun God, Ra, is referred to as Satan in the bible. As if that were not enough, if you take the height and width and multiply them by 12, effectively converting the measurement from feet to inches, you end up with 6,666 inches and 666 inches respectively. Occult representation here being that we all know that 666 represents the mark of the Beast, or Satan himself. <a href="http://www.incapabledesetaire.com/edito/secretwash.htm">Other</a> speculations are that the Monument is actually a solar calendar that goes along with the Mayan Calendar and prophecies, whilst it doesn&#8217;t really support my claim, nor does it refute it, but this is definitely something to think about.</p>
<p>To the normal citizen the White House is the house in which The President of the United States resides. For the conspirator, we see that maybe the president isn&#8217;t whom we believe him to be. The <a title="Inverted Pentagram" href="http://home.hiwaay.net/~jalison/wsh5.jpg">inverted Pentagram</a>, who&#8217;s apex falls right upon the White House is very apparent in this map. Although pentagrams were not originally signs of evil or occult nature, in early times they were actually used to ward evil, the one pictured is inverted. In religion the inversion of symbols is Satanic in nature, think about how the inverted cross represents the opposite of what it usually does.  It also seems very similar to this image of the <a href="http://www.cuttingedge.org/news/goathead.gif">Goathead Pentagram</a>. The upper four points of the pentagram are represenative of the four elements of the world, Earth, Fire, Water, Air, while the fifth point on the bottom represents the spirit of Lucifer. The far left and right points of the pentagram are formed by Washington Circle and Mt. Vernon Square. The top three points of the pentagram, <a href="http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/chapter3/dupont_circle.jpg">Dupont Circle</a>, <a href="http://freemasonrywatch.org/pics/logan_circle.jpg">Logan Circle</a>, and <a href="http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/chapter3/scott_circle.jpg">Scott Circle</a> in the center also exhibit occult underlying. From the images you can see that each of these three circles intersects six major streets. 666, now the whole coincidence excuse is getting a little weary. The question begging to be answered here is why would anyone in their right mind want to associate the spirit of Lucifer with the White House?</p>
<p>The Jefferson Memorial, which completes the other leg of the Masonic Compass, was a much different memorial than the previous two. The overall design seemed to be from a different architectural stand point or era than that of the Washington Monument and the White House. From the map it seems as if the monument is fairly aligned with the White House, and if you measure a straight line from the center of the White House to the Center of the Jefferson Memorial, you end up with a length of 1776 meters. Interestingly enough, if you have a dollar bill, look at the base of the pyramid, the roman numerals translate out to 1776. While not necessarily a occult referecne, we can see that the Freemason ties are in everything from our money to our monuments.</p>
<p>The appearance of the Freemason Compass and Square in our nations capital is just an inkling in to part of what many believe is a conspiracy by &#8217;secret rulers.&#8217; With satanic sybolism polluting our nations capital, its a little hard to deny what I&#8217;ve uncovered while doing this assignment. Whether or not these symbols were intentional by design is a question that can be argued for years. The only way to truely comprehend what is going on, would be to know everything about Freemasonry, everything about astrology, everything about architecture, and lots and lots of history. At that point you would probably know too much and the Freemasons would have you killed so that they can continue their plan of World Dominance without your meddling.</p>

					<p>When one thinks of the national mall, thoughts of sunny days and tourist-infested monuments are what usually fills the imagination. What goes largely unseen though to the public at large is the artistic view of the national mall at night. <strong>The effects of the monuments at night are just as powerful, if not more so, than the effects in the light of day. </strong><br />
The first monument I came to was the Vietnam War Memorial. The monument in general has a somber, reflective quality to it. This is due to the numerous names engraved upon the wall of those who died in the Vietnam war, and the physically reflective quality of the marble used. The guise of night greatly enhances these qualities. Walking down the path, the monument would hardly be noticeable save for the string of dim lights along the wall. I feel that this is analogous to the way that the Vietnam war is viewed today. The toll on America from the Vietnam war goes by mostly unnoticed, except as a row of dim lights in the minds of most Americans. Another attribute the monument possesses at night is the absence of the tour groups and children. It really then allows for a chance of quiet introspection on the events that spurred the creation of the monument.<br />
The next monument I visited was the World War II Memorial. To me this monument is very peculiar. Unlike the monuments erected for other wars, this memorial does not make any mention of individual names other than the names of leaders under powerful quotes. This helps to see the event as impersonal and as a grand victory. The memorial at night also accentuates these qualities. At night there is powerful, bright lighting all around the monument, and most stunningly the giant grandiose fountains are lit up. This further conveys the atmosphere of powerful celebration within the monument.  Also, there are four hundred gold stars lit up towards the rear of the monument, which are impressive. Although they represent deaths, they are golden stars which represent patriotism which is in stark contrast to the Vietnam memorial. It is almost as if the statement is being made saying that the soldiers who died in this war died for a good cause. Precisely at midnight at this monument, something amazing happened. The fountains were shut off, and some of the lighting around the edges grew dim, leaving just a giant pool of water in the center of the monument. It may not have been planned to have this effect, but I thought it signified that behind this great victory was also a serious loss, due to the war and to the Holocaust. This memorial at first inspired awe with its fantastic, bright visuals, and then brought out a more mellow mood at midnight.<br />
The last memorial which I sought out was the Korean War Memorial. In the day time, this monument is definitely very creepy, and possibly the most personal out of all of the monuments. The one thing that differs from the monument during the day and night, is that during the day, the small bed of water at the end of the path has a serene tranquility about it, while at night, the stillness and deep blackness of it is very foreboding. At night the whole monument has a very ghostly feel to it. This feeling is immediately brought out by the figures of the soldiers at war. At night, these are very poorly lit, and look almost like specters reliving their war experiences. When one can get a good look at the facial expressions exhibited by these statues, one can see looks of uncertainty, grief, and horror. This is also analogous to the uncertainty in this time of America’s history with the act of entering into the Korean War. To further illustrate the ghostly quality of the monument, the wall which works as the backdrop to the garden of figures is hardly visible, shown upon by a row of dim lights as in the Vietnam War memorial. The faces upon the wall are also barely visible, and the greys in which they are engraved give the characters a further ghostly feeling about them. The monument at night, depicts the Korean War as a horrible and ghastly conflict in the history of the United States.</p>
<p>Although it was through a crazy chain of events that I ended up going to the national mall at night, it was a very awe inspiring time. I wasn’t expecting the refreshingly quiet introspection I was greeted with. I recommend to anybody that truly appreciates these monuments and the history associated with them to go and take a visit at night. The aura of night greatly enhances the architectural and emotional effects of each monument.</p>

					<p>A monument is something erected in memory of a person, event, etc., such as a building, pillar, or statue. The National Mall in Washington D.C. is a convenient location for everyone to enjoy many monuments dedicated to people, presidents, wars, and soldiers, and is a nice environment to relax and to reflect. Each memorial is different and has different “rules,” themes, feelings, thoughts, and presence. For example, the rushing fountains of the World War II memorial have a very different atmosphere than the secluded garden of the World War I memorial. However the goal of all the memorials is the same, to show honor and respect to the object it is remembering. <strong>The </strong><strong>Lincoln</strong><strong> Memorial, </strong><strong>Washington</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Monument</strong><strong>, and Thomas Jefferson Memorial commemorate presidential legacies, depicting the men as the greatness they were through size and the atmosphere in which they are surrounded. </strong>Although they are all simple statues they all portray the men they represent in a powerful way.<br />
 </p>
<p>The Washington Monument is the most prominent, and one of the oldest memorials in Washington D.C., as well as the tallest building in the entire city. Completed in 1885, the Washington Monument stands erect in the West end of the National Mall at 555 feet. The structure is overwhelming in size and it is extremely hard to take in the entire view in a simple gaze. The Washington Monument was built in honor of George Washington, who led our country to independence and was later our nation’s first president. At the base of the monument are fifty flags, representing the fifty states. I find this to be odd since when Washington was president, there were not fifty states. Perhaps the flags show what an accomplishment his nation has become and how it has flourished. Washington achieved much greatness as a single man, and in honor of him, a single astonishing structure is placed in his honor. The monument is too much to take in at one glance, and there is more to acknowledge about George Washington in a single thought. The Washington Monument seems to tower over everything, and in fact it is still the tallest building in the District of Columbia. There is a rumor that a law states that nothing is allowed to be created taller than the Washington Monument, however, I discovered that the law states that a building’s height cannot be made more than 20 feet greater than the width of the adjacent street. I enjoyed the thought that no building was allowed to be taller, it put more power into the Washington Monument. There is much more though that makes this monument powerful. There Washington Monument can be seen from thirty to forty miles (on a clear day). That means that even outside of Washington D.C. one can remember our first president. No other memorial on the Mall is like that. In fact most require you to actually be up close and in the memorial to really see all that it has to offer.<br />
 </p>
<p>Both the Thomas Jefferson Memorial and the Lincoln Memorial, require you to be inside the structure in order to take in the awe of the memorial. Even though the Lincoln Memorial building can be seen from the Washington Monument, it is mysterious and pulls you to walk the distance to see what it is. Once inside the columns you are blown away by the enormous statue of Abraham Lincoln hidden from the outside. The statue is nineteen feet tall and is very intimidating, however inspiring. Lincoln is depicted sitting down and has a serious look on his face that demands respect from onlookers. One hand is clenched and the other is open. Could this be showing the strong, forceful side of Lincoln on one hand and the calm fatherly side of him on the other. Above the sixteenth president is the dedication, “IN THIS TEMPLE AS IN THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM HE SAVED THE UNION THE MEMORY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN IS ENSHRINED FOREVER.” These words are visible over Lincoln’s head, however they do come secondary to the main highlight of the memorial, Lincoln. The exhibit’s atmosphere is quiet and respectful. Whenever I think of Abraham Lincoln, I think of the phrase “honest Abe” and when I was in the memorial, I remembered that and was very respectful and just took in all of the surroundings. On the south wall is Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address is inscribed and Lincoln&#8217;s second inaugural address is inscribed on the north wall. It is nice to be able to read the powerful words spoken by Lincoln in his presence. The exterior of the Lincoln Memorial is more relaxed and there are steps where one can relax and gather your thoughts as you gaze at the reflecting pool. Lincoln was known as the Great Emancipator and preserver of the nation during the Civil War. Being at the end of the reflecting pool and sitting in both its presence and Lincoln’s allows for one to think about those events and the fact that without this man and his work, the world would be a different place.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Jefferson Memorial has a little bit of a different vibe. The Lincoln Memorial is complemented by the reflecting pool, and the Jefferson Memorial is complemented by the Cherry Blossom Trees, however only visible in March and April. The Cherry Blossoms are celebrated with a festival announcing their arrival, and Thomas Jefferson is celebrated with his work on the Declaration of Independence, which is celebrated with many Fourth of July festivals. The exterior feeling of the Jefferson Memorial is that of a celebration, but the interior of the Jefferson Memorial is peaceful and respectful.<br />
The Jefferson Memorial is located in West Potomac Park on the shore of the Tidal Basin of the Potomac River, across the street and part of the river from the other monuments. Like the Lincoln Memorial the main component of the Jefferson Memorial is hidden in the shadows until one steps foot inside the columns. Once inside, you are greeted by a nineteen foot, ten thousand pound, bronze statue of the third president, Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson is depicted standing tall and proud. Under the stature is a sentence taken out of one of Jefferson’s letters, &#8220;I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.&#8221; This phrase fills one with pride for our country and gives you the feeling of triumph, freedom, and everything our country stands for. I associate this feeling with the same feeling you get on the fourth of July. Also located in the Jefferson Memorial is an excerpt from the Declaration of Independence, for which Jefferson was known for drafting.<br />
 </p>
<p>Even though each of these memorials are different, they are also very alike in which they honor the men for which they stand. The Washington Monument is a single structure with more power than a thousand little structures. The Washington Monument will forever be known for its records and everything will appear tiny in comparison, and Washington will forever be known for his achievements and all presidents compared to our first. The Lincoln Memorial commemorates a man known for changing the world and also gives you a chance to sit and reflect on this. One is intimidated by the size and look on his face and can not help but be respectful in his presence. The Jefferson Memorial calls for respect and patriarchy, and even though one feels respect, you also cannot help but be proud and feel free. It is hard to believe what power and emotion can come from stone.   </p>

					<p>Washington DC the capital of the untied states. When you want to learn history then you should go to national mall in Washington DC. The national mall is an open area national park, and you can find a lot of history museums, monuments and memorials. <strong>People can receiver message from the ways the memorials design, so people can remember certain time or event in history.also people act differently in each memorial.  </strong>World War II memorial, Korean War memorial and Vietnam War memorial are three biggest memorials and also the most people go visit those three memorials in Washington DC. Those three memorials are the place I always go, because I can really a lot and also to remember them. <strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>World War II memorial is the youngest memorial in national mall. World War II memorial opened to the public on April 29, 2004, and was dedicated on May 29. As it opening, thousands of people visited the memorial from all parts of country. The memorial consists of 56 pillars, each pillar about 17 feet tall, and you can 56 states name on each pillar. 56 pillars symbolizing national unity represent the states, territories, and District of Columbia that comprised the United States during the World War II.  Between pillars there are two big memorial arches at the north and south entrance to the memorial plaza, those two arches commemorate victory from Atlantic to pacific. Walk into plaza, there is big fountains in the rainbow pool. The rainbow pool will be restored to their historic configuration. Most people visit World War II memorial, every time when I go there, and I can see people are setting there with their family. Children are running around the rainbow pool, and some kids are playing water with other people. Every one is looking so happy. I think people like to visit World War II memorial, because the United States didn’t lose war, they had big victory during World War II. However, whoever designs this memorial really wants to us remember those people who were fighting for untied states, who lost their lives during the World War II.</p>
<p>After walk short distance you can see Korean War memorial on your left side. The memorial is in the form of triangle intersecting a circle. Walk in to the memorial, there are 19 stainless steel statues stand in middle of memorial. When I walk close to the statues I can see how they look on their face, from their looking I can really tell what they were doing during the Korean War. After I saw those statues I can imagine how the war was. Behind the those statues there is 164 foot long black granite wall with photographic images sandblasted into it depicting soldiers, equipment and people involved in the war. I really like this war, because you can see how those soldiers looking during the Korean War.  People are so happy in World War II memorial, but people walk into Korean War memorial they are really act differently. They are so quit no one talking, they just walk along the war, look at the images on the war. I am sure they are really respectful in this memorial. “Freedom is not free” now I know what is really mean. Freedom is not free you really have to fight for it.</p>
<p>Vietnam War memorial is right cross reflection pool from Korean War memorial. The memorial wall is made up of two black granite walls, those walls are very similar. However, the different between those two walls is the Vietnam war wall has all veterans name on the memorial walls who dies during the Vietnam War. When a visitor looks upon the wall, his or her reflection can be seen simultaneously with the engraved names, which is meant to symbolically bring the past and present together. I am really amazing the silence in memorial, I even can hear wind blow. People just walk along with wall, and look at wall with soldiers name. people also can find book, which it has all soldiers name who die during the war.</p>
<p>After visited three memorials, and I really learn a lot. Also I really respect those people who die during the war. each memorial bring out three different emotions. Though people feeling and emotion, they find personal connection to each memorial. People are taking tour to those three memorial, they can find two different sides to war. so people can really respect soldiers respect what they done for their country.</p>

				<h2><a href="/courses/history120/spring07/i-have-never-felt-so-small.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to I Have Never Felt So Small">I Have Never Felt So Small</a></h2>
				<small>May 8th, 2007 <!-- by llundgre --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Monuments never struck me as being interesting, or a must see, but I was very surprised at how each of the monuments made me feel. Each had a different feeling attached but they all overwhelmingly made me feel humbled. The monuments made me have a different respect for history and for the great city, Washington D.C., which is only a few miles from our home. The immense humbling feeling I received made me wonder how a building could do that to me. How does the design of the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, and the World War II Memorial make you feel so incredibly humbled and small.</p>
<p>The Washington Monument can be seen from just about anywhere in Washington D.C. If your high enough up. The monument greets you when you are entering Washington D.C. from Virginia. It reminds you of the history of the great city every time you pass it but it does not show its true potential until you see it in person. When seeing the Washington Monument and looking to the sky surrounded by American Flags, you feel a sense of meekness and empowerment at the same time. Was this what the builders had imagined the monument to do? How does the monument bring about so many emotions when it is just a building? The Washington Monument is not an elaborate building but it is high. It towers over you to make George Washington seem larger than life. I do not think it just stands for George Washington any more. The feeling I received from the monument was that it stood for not only the first president but the city as well as the country. The height and strength of the building is what makes emotions soar when visiting, unlike the World War II Memorial.</p>
<p>The World War II Memorial evokes a sense of reflection and humble thinking. It made me feel small while being there. I felt as if I have not done enough in my life compared to the people that fought and died in the war. I could not figure out why I felt that way at the memorial but not while learning about World War II. The memorial was so large in proportion that it makes you feel small and insignificant. I walked through and there was so much to look at compared to other monuments. What other monuments have in sheer size this monument has in size and remembrances. The World War II Memorial has the potential to make you spend the day looking at everything that is there. The memorial may not be tall and overpowering but it is large. The memorial also has huge fountains which drown out noise that helps you concentrate on what you are looking at. The pillars at each side look small in comparison to the memorial but the fact that twenty people can stand inside comfortably does not do the pillars much justice. The pillars are extremely large and empowering from the inside, exactly like the Lincoln Memorial.</p>
<p>The Lincoln Memorial and its grandeur is incredible. From far away it somewhat resembles the White House. I thought the statue of Abraham Lincoln was going to be life-like and that the building would not be that big on the inside, I was completely wrong. The Lincoln Memorial took me aback. It was hard to believe how strong it mad me feel standing on the stairs looking out onto the Washington Monument. The memorial made me feel differently when I walked in. I felt very small and humbled in front of the Abraham Lincoln Statue.</p>
<p>The Lincoln Memorial, World War II Memorial, and the Washington Monument humble you just by the way they are built to make you feel insecure standing next to them. The monuments make you feel as if you are not as good as the people they are made after. They make you feel as if you are small in comparison to the people the monuments were made after. The monuments evoke a lot of feelings which no text book could possibly bring about.</p>

					<p>The monuments in Washington D.C. give us an opportunity to respect and<br />
honor our past heroes and leaders.  Each memorial has distinct and<br />
significant characteristics reflecting how we remember the person or people<br />
the monument memorializes.  They also have a few similar traits as well. The<br />
size of each masterpiece is a notable congruence between many of those in<br />
D.C. as well as their positioning around the nation¹s capital.  <strong>The<br />
monuments on the national mall conjure up images of power, significance and achievement through their size, placement and detail.<br />
</strong><br />
George Washington is the most celebrated and storied president in United<br />
States history.  So significant is the country’s first president that many<br />
universities, streets and counties have been named after him not to mention<br />
a state and the US capital.  After so many dedications one may see yet<br />
another one to be excessive and meaningless and so the Washington monument<br />
had to be something spectacular, and it is!  Like the man himself, the<br />
monument dominates the surrounding space.  Washington himself was extremely<br />
tall for the time period, measuring over six feet and this is represented<br />
splendidly in the size of the monument.  It is only fitting that no building<br />
in DC can be built taller than the Washington monument.  If something were<br />
built bigger, it would detract from how we remember the man and go a long<br />
way to denigrate the monument’s significance. Washington is also remembered<br />
for the unfaltering military leadership he provided to the colonists in the<br />
face of the world’s most powerful military during the Revolutionary War.<br />
Another important facet of the memorial is its placement.  The monument<br />
dominates the surrounding skyline and no building in sight is half the size<br />
of the memorial, as a building even close to rivaling its grandeur would<br />
surely detract from the overall appearance and power it commands. Its<br />
placement is another aspect that highlights the important role Washington<br />
played in US history. His monument is at the end of the National Mall<br />
directly opposite the nation’s capital. The country’s democracy is run<br />
primarily through the Capitol building and the Washington monument is facing<br />
one of the most important structures in the world, as if to say that without<br />
George Washington, this building may not be here today. The final aspect of<br />
the monument that commands respect from its many visitors is its attention<br />
to detail. It needed exactly 36,491 marble and granite blocks to complete<br />
the monument and each of these stones had to be a specific size and weight<br />
in order to fit together perfectly.  The monument as a whole asserts a<br />
prominent and commanding image on the nation’s capital and this mirrors<br />
Washington¹s influence on his fellow colonials during his lifetime.</p>
<p>The second monument I visited was the recently completed World War II<br />
memorial.  The monument is a fitting tribute to those who gave their lives<br />
for their country and again size, placement and detail represent the<br />
ultimate sacrifice these soldiers had to make.  Initially one will notice<br />
the size of this monument.  Although it does not dominate the skyline like<br />
the Washington monument, the shape and width of the memorial represent many<br />
people rather than just one.  The placement of this memorial is quite<br />
significant as it stands in line with the Washington Monument and the<br />
Capitol building.  Not only is the placement of the monument important on an<br />
emotive level, it is also highly aesthetically pleasing to see the structure<br />
in line with the Washington Monument.  When one takes a step back and takes<br />
in the memorial in front of the Washington Monument, there is really no more<br />
powerful sight in the whole of Washington D.C.  If the Washington Monument<br />
is remarkable because of its size, the WWII monument is most certainly<br />
impressive for its detail.  The first aspect of detail one may notice is the<br />
symmetry.  The angles and shapes involved in this structure look almost too<br />
perfect to be real.  This symmetry could represent each and every member of<br />
the military during WWII equally as every man who served risked dying.  The<br />
52 columns outlining the monument represent another impressive aspect of the<br />
monument.  Each column is exactly the same height except for the two big<br />
columns at either side of the memorial that represent the Pacific and<br />
Atlantic oceans.  These columns show the individual states that supplied<br />
troops to fight in the world’s biggest war and represent how unity as<br />
opposed to division won the war.  The pool in the middle of the monument is<br />
another important detail and is the most popular part of the memorial for<br />
visitors, especially in the summer.  This pool represents eternal sacrifice<br />
of the troops as the pool is constantly full and is another way of saying<br />
that we will never forget.  The field of 4,000 gold stars is possibly the<br />
most significant part of the entire memorial.  Each star represents a<br />
thousand of the 400,000 who died during the course of the United State¹s<br />
involvement in the war.  The feeling this wall generates in the many<br />
visitors is one of deep sadness but also one of appreciation to those who<br />
served and died fighting for freedom and their country.  The WWII memorial<br />
represents the more than 400,000 Americans who died fighting for what they<br />
held sacred.  From the positioning of the monument to the extreme detail<br />
taken by the architect, this memorial helps us to remember those brave men<br />
and women who lost their lives during World War II.</p>
<p>The last monument I visited was the Lincoln memorial.  This memorial was<br />
completely different to the first two I had visited and as it exhibited a<br />
human form in the shape of a seated Abraham Lincoln.  This monument’s size<br />
is its distinguishing feature much like the Washington Monument.  The size<br />
represents the significance and importance of Lincoln in American history<br />
and his role in the Civil War to keep the country united and to free the<br />
slave.  Lincoln was also a great orator and two of his famous speeches are<br />
inscribed on the inside of the “temple”.  The Gettysburg Address and<br />
Lincoln’s second inaugural address represent two of the greatest speeches in<br />
the history of the United States and the sheer size of the inscriptions on<br />
the inside of the memorial highlight the effect those words had on the<br />
course of events during and after the Civil War.  Again placement is a major<br />
aspect of the memorial and is part of the reason I chose to visit this<br />
particular memorial.  The positioning of this memorial in line with the<br />
Capitol, the Washington Monument and the WWII memorial represent just how<br />
significant Lincoln’s presidency was and is.  It seems that memorials and<br />
monuments on the National Mall are to those who had the greatest influence<br />
on this relatively young country’s history and it is a great testament of<br />
Abraham Lincoln’s presidency and life that his memorial would be put on the<br />
same level as these monuments. Finally, detail on this monument was a key in<br />
adequately memorializing this great American president. Everything about the<br />
statue of Lincoln is accurate from facial characteristics to the scale of<br />
his frame.  The 36 columns at the entrance represent the 36 Union at the<br />
time of Lincoln’s death and this is highly significant as there may not have<br />
been a Union at that time had Lincoln not been president.  The placement of<br />
this monument signifies Abraham Lincoln’s importance and place in American<br />
history.  Details such as the two inscriptions on the inside of the monument<br />
as well as the 36 columns at the entrance to the memorial show visitors just<br />
how important Abraham Lincoln was to the United States.</p>
<p>The three monuments I visited all had a similar location and significance in<br />
American history.  Lincoln and Washington were two of the nations most<br />
important and influential president’s while World War II<br />
represented one of the costliest wars America has ever participated in.  I<br />
chose these four monuments because I felt that each one remembered either<br />
great achievement or remembered great sacrifice. Each memorial evoked<br />
entirely different emotions and the size, placement and detail of each<br />
monument effected how I perceived and thought about each one.<br />

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Touring the National Mall was something I have always wanted to do (being a history major and just generally loving to visit museums and the like), so I was very excited when we were assigned to do this project. I expected to find memorials, plain and simply. However, as I moved from one to another, I realized that you cannot help but feel different emotions. Walking through and around the monuments, the most prominent feature I noticed about each was the intention to make you feel personally connected to each place and story. Most notably, the fact that at each of the monuments I chose, the Vietnam War Memorial, the World War II Memorial, and the Lincoln Memorial, seeing your reflection was specifically used in different ways. <strong>Designers of each of the monuments includes an aspect of reflection in order to make the viewers feel personally connected to what the monument represents.</strong></p>
<p>The Vietnam War Memorial is one of the younger memorials, constructed in 1982. It was designed by Maya Ying Lin and consists of two black, granite walls. This specific type of granite was chosen because of its reflective quality. While I was standing amongst all the people who were visiting the memorial that day, I was amazed by the utter silence. I felt a sense of deep respect and I believe everyone who was looking at the wall was feeling very similar. I think this memorial comes across as, not necessiarly anti-war, but there is more of a feeling of loss here than at some other memorials, most likely because you can corralate the names to actual people and their families. Standing in front of the Vietnam War Memorial, you can understand why the designer felt it was so important for the viewer to be able to see themselves among all the names. While looking at your own reflection, not only does it cause you to think about all these men that gave their lives, but also makes you feel as though the past and present are undenialbly connected to one another. This feeling is just as prevalent when you take the time to look at each of the items left by family and friends under the wall. It is obvious to any that the Vietnam War has and continues to affect thousands of people, and the reflective nature of the granite helps to show this.</p>
<p>While the Vietnam War Memorial provides a somber atmosphere, there is of course a memorial that brings out a happy, carefree feeling. The National World War II Memorial, while still a war memorial, evokes something completely different than the Vietnam War Memorial. The World War II Memorial is the youngest on the mall, just having been completed in 2004. Designed by Friedrich St. Florian, the memorial is a circluar structure with 56 pillars, each with the states and territories of the United States at the time of World War II. The middle holds a huge fountain pool, with the fountains shooting high into the air. Here, reflecting is mostly done in a celebratory manner. Children are running around and the area is much louder, with people talking and laughing, than at any other memorial. Why this memorial is depicted this way is a bit unanswered. Perhaps it is because of the portrayed success and victory of good triumphing evil throughout World War II. Perhaps because it was built so recently, events like the war in Iraq were beginning to loose favor and this could remind people of the feeling of winning a war. I believe it is a bit of a combination of both, and I&#8217;m sure other things depending upon who is interpreting the memorial. Whatever the reason for the difference in design style, I think the atmosphere is good and needed, especially if you have already visited the more somber memorials.</p>
<p>Leaving the World War II Memorial, you automatically come upon the Reflecting Pool, which lies between the World War II Memorial and the Lincoln Memorial. The Reflecting Pool is not really a memorial of any sort, but definitely has its own atmosphere and connects up to the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. As it name implies, this is a place where many people sit and have lunch or just some peace and quiet. It is shallow, only about 3 feet deep, and has a natural calming effect. Walking from the World War II Memorial, this calm is needed as you approach the Lincoln Memorial. Approaching the Lincoln Memorial is a sight in itself. It was designed by Henry Bacon to mimic a Greek Doric temple, for example the Parthenon. Climbing up the steps, you can&#8217;t immediate see the huge statue of Abraham Lincoln. However, one you walk in past the columns, the first time you see the statue, it is a bit breathtaking. The statue sits 19 feet tall and immediately causes you to feel a sense of authority. Looking up at the huge man, instead of feeling the need to relate yourself directly to the people or situation, you simply marvel at the wonderful reputation this man must have had to deserve something so grand. On the walls are two of his most well known speeches, the Gettysburg Address and his second inaugural address. Looking at these, especially the Gettysburg Address, you get the sense of how important these were in his time as president. While it may not be a personal reflection, the Lincoln Memorial still evokes certain emotions that cause a personal connection and strong apprecation to a great president.</p>
<p>While each memorial definitely brings out three different emotions, each causes the viewers to reflect on the memorial and look inward. If you are open and receptive to the emotional aspect of the memorials, anyone can find a personal connection to each monument, whether you and your family has been directly affected by any of the events or historical figures. I believe in order to appreciate history and learn from it, we MUST feel personally connected to events that have happened in our country&#8217;s past. Taking a tour of war cites like the World War II Memorial and the Vietnam Memorial can show you both sides to a war. The Lincoln Memorial can give you a sense that many great people have led our nation to allow it to become something great and all hope is not lost (if you so happen to feel that way with current issues). Each memorial gives a new, different reflection than the next and it is important to take the time to investigate each of these.</p>

				<h2><a href="/courses/history120/spring07/national-mall-essay.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to National Mall Essay: Monuments and Water">National Mall Essay: Monuments and Water</a></h2>
				<small>May 7th, 2007 <!-- by maiko2387 --></small>

					<p>The three monuments I chose to write about are the Jefferson Monument, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Monument, and the World War II Monument.  <strong>I chose these three monuments because all three monuments use water to express their message about a certain time or person in history.</strong>  The interesting part about these monuments is that although they use water to convey their messages, they all use the water in very different ways.   It is also interesting to note that the Jefferson Memorial was actually created by Roosevelt in 1943.</p>
<p>The Jefferson Memorial is unique in that it does not actually have water in the monument, but it uses water as part of its message.   The memorial is separated from all the other monuments by a large body of water.   When you stand on top of the monument, you can see the whole city and when it is sunny, the water makes the whole scene sparkle.  It suggests that Jefferson is watching over the capitol city and more generally the entire country.  It is like looking at a utopian civilization.  The monument is a tribute to the way he viewed America.  He envisioned a new and beautiful country with unlimited possibilities.  From the top of the monument, you can only see the pretty parts of America; you cannot see the any of the country’s problems.  That is what the artist most likely intended.  In addition, when you look at the monument from the other side of the water, it stands alone and resembles a Grecian temple.  In fact, the monument is constructed using Greek type architecture.  The artist likens Jefferson to a Greek god.  This is a symbolic analogy because Greek Gods were revered by their people as creators and saviors.  Jefferson can be thought of in that way in America.  Jefferson was one of the founding  fathers of our country.  He authored the Declaration of Independence, assisted in the development of the Constitution, and almost doubled the size of our country with the Louisiana Purchase.  He is one of the creators of our country and the artist did a good job in remembering him.</p>
<p>The Franklin Delano Roosevelt Monument, on the other hand, uses water extensively within the monument.  The water symbolizes the different degrees of turbulence and conflict during his four terms in office.   The first waterfall, which signifies his first term in office, is just one huge waterfall.  The waterfall symbolizes the Great Depression.   It was the one huge hurdle that FDR knew that he needed to tackle, and starting his New Deal was the only thing he needed to focus on.  The second waterfall, which signified FDR’s second term, is different than the first waterfall because it has steps.  It is more bumpy than the first one.  This symbolizes how the economic and social problems which FDR had to deal with became more complicated in his second term.  Not only did he have to continue dealing with the Great Depression, but he also had to start dealing with the war abroad.  Although we were not in the war for the majority of his second term, we still could not help but to have some involvement in the conflict.  Things were staring to get more turbulent for him.  The third waterfall, which symbolizes his third term, is different  than the previous two because it is made up of more than one waterfall.  The waterfalls are made up of many broken rocks upon which the water crashes down.  These multiple waterfalls and high pressure water is symbolic of the multiple problems that FDR faced during his third term.  Pearl Harbor had been bombed at the end of his second term, and we had no choice but to enter the war.  The depression was starting to get a little better with the war effort, but there were still many things which needed to be fixed.   Lastly,  the fourth waterfall, which symbolizes FDR’s fourth term, also consists of more than one waterfall, and even more waterfalls than the previous one.  The waterfalls in this set are also have water crashing down on an array of rocks at the bottom.  The reason there are even more rocks in the fourth set is because by FDR’s fourth term, there were even more problems to be solved.  The world was in disarray during this time.  The debate of whether or not to drop the atom bomb was going on, parts of Europe were completely destroyed, Americans had lost many family members to the war, and troops were still fighting.  The economy was doing better, but that was largely a result of the war and the need for increases in production.  People did not know if things would downshift again once the war was over and the additional jobs were not necessary.  FDR had a lot of decisions to make and a lot of problems to grapple with during this time, and the multiple waterfalls, and rocks represent this state of turbulence.</p>
<p>The third monument I picked was the World War II Memorial.  This one also uses water within the monument to help convey its message.  In this monument, there is a huge pool of water in the middle called the rainbow pool.   There is a pillar on each side of the water, one is inscribed Pacific, and the other is inscribed as the Atlantic.  The American states and territories are then arranged in a circle around the water, somewhat in their geographic relation to the corresponding ocean pillar.  In the middle of the pool of water, there two large flowing fountains and various littler ones.  The two main fountains symbolize the Allies and the Axis powers, and the littler ones most likely symbolize the countries who made up these two sides.  The two fountains are far apart to symbolize how far apart the two sides were in their thoughts ideologies.   In addition, water is used in another way in this monument.  In the back of the monument there is a wall with 4,000 stars, and each star symbolizes 100 lives which were lost during the war.  Under the wall is a small reflecting pool.  Looking at the stars on the wall in conjunction with the stars in the reflecting pool gives you a sense of the magnitude of the loss.  Also seeing the stars reflecting in the water gives you the sense that they will live on forever in our nation’s memory.</p>

					<p><strong>The white noise and landscaping surrounding War Memorials can subtly affect the mood of those visiting the site.</strong> By observing the people attending a Memorial and paying attention to the feeling one gets it is easy to see how this is true.</p>
<p>            At the World War II Memorial one walks straight into a tourist mess. There are kids running everywhere, people talking in loud voices and the occasional couple seated along the fountain enjoying a romantic afternoon. The Memorial has a lighthearted feel to it, one of comfort more than anything else. Even the fountains are loud; you can hear the water rushing into the air before clapping against more water. The Memorial expresses the feeling of brotherhood that drove many soldiers to fight for the man next to them. The loud and rambunctious pride many WWII movies try to capture almost carries into those attending the Memorial. Most importantly one does not get the feeling of disrespect from the running kids and loud families, it is almost as if that is how the “Brothers-In-Arms” would have had it.</p>
<p>            The District of Columbia War Memorial is in stark contrast to the before mentioned. Walking up to the Memorial it is almost like walking into an ancient ruin, there are trees among trees and just before reaching the site there are hundreds of perfectly kept flowers. There is not much talking to be done here and whispering comes completely natural. While listening to the area you can hear nothing but scurrying squirrels and rustling leaves, it is mostly serene and deep thoughts are certainly not hard to capture. Unlike the WWII and Korean War Memorials, the stone is not flawless slate, it has cracks and chips and it does not reflect; the plant life makes it easy not to notice though.</p>
<p>            The last Memorial I chose to use was the Korean War Memorial. There were a lot of people here, most of them were looking down more often than not and all were near silent. The Memorial puts an immediate weight on one’s chest, a burden almost; it is not a feeling of deep thought like the War Memorial but more a feeling of sadness. The statue soldiers frozen in mid action are standing on unkempt, almost dead grass growing between bits of gravel. I thought it was interesting that the stone was flawless and the water was seemingly drinkable as it reflected the sun, flowing perfectly over edges. Looking into the reflecting stones depicting those lives lost you can faintly see your own face, blending among those who died; it is hard not to get lost in the image appreciating everything those soldiers have done for us. The last picture I took I felt like summed up all the Memorials, “Freedom Is Not Free”.</p>
<p>            The most faint things easily sway our moods, feelings and actions. I think it is amazing how things as simple as flowers or water or even the cracks (or lack of cracks) in stones can affect the image we portray through our actions. I find it fascinating that it is not disrespectful to talk loudly or run through the WWII Memorial but you really wouldn’t dare do the same at the Korean War Memorial, at least not without some pretty mean stares. It is all to easy to get lost in thought at these Memorials, especially when provoked by an assignment like this and that is what I think the intention truly was for the designers. To provoke thought, and to provoke emotion.</p>

					<p>        “They came, they saw, they conquered, and now the Americans dominate the world like no nation before.” This sentiment taken from Guardian Magazine expresses how many people feel about the modern United States. The Roman Empire was the superpower of its era, and now the U.S. has willingly taken over its reins. Comparisons with the former empire can extend to military power, government, citizenships, imperialism, and many other areas. One undeniable imitation of the Roman Empire can be seen throughout Washington D.C.. <strong>Numerous buildings, monuments, and statues were built, around the capitol, with a Roman architectural style to imitate the power and prestige of former world power.</strong>       </p>
<p>       History portrays Roman culture as a very sophisticated nation. In school, we are taught about towering figures in history, like Augustus, Nero, and Marcus Aurelius. In literature, Shakespeare immortalizes the best know leader of the Roman Empire, in the play Julius Caesar. History will forever have Rome be synonymous with greatness. While visiting the U.S capitol, it is impossible to not see the towering pillars, large domed buildings, and statues canonizing American figures. I believe, in an attempt imitate the Roman Empire, the United States used a Roman designed architecture to be seen as great. For history to remember the U.S. in a positive light, it must attempt to be seen as elite, and embracing an aspect of the Roman Empire into our culture, it helps perpetuate that sense of greatness. </p>
<p>       The buildings and monuments throughout D.C. are not considered one distinct architectural style. However, many of the buildings that imitate Roman culture are very similar to a style called Beaux-Arts. It can be characterized by two distinct designs: “Symmetry and hierarchy of spaces, from “noble spaces”—grand entrances and staircases—to utilitarian ones.” There have been some adaptations to the style, but it has remained consistent since its creation in Paris, during the 17th century. The style naturally conveys sensations of being elite, which helps the U.S. be seen as a great nation.</p>
<p>	The First monument I choose to look at was the Jefferson Memorial. Of the three structures I choose, I realized that it looked most like classic Roman and Greek Temples. The monument is also interesting because of its location. Located in Washington D.C West Potomac Park, near the shore of the Potomac River Tidal Basin, it suggests how important roman architecture is to the U.S.. Created during the early 20th century, the monument could have been built using a more modern design, but instead, it continued a tradition of building monuments like Roman temples. The circular pillars, dome on top, and marble bricks are all part of classical Roman structures. With further exploration I learned, the designer of the monument, John Russell Pope, used the Beaux-Arts style.  Thomas Jefferson, our third president, was also fascinated with Roman architecture and used the style to design Monticello and the Rotunda after the Pantheon of Rome. </p>
<p>        The Lincoln Monument was the second I realized looked very similar to the classic examples of Roman architecture.  After researching the structure, I found out it was not designed in the Beaux-Arts style, but it contained the symmetric and “higher spaces” design functions. One of the most famous locations in the National Mall, I thought that it was very important and consistent that the monument look similar to the Roman architecture. All of the monuments were designed with specific purposes and functions. I believe the purpose behind creating the Lincoln Memorial, was to be a symbol of power and prestige. Abraham Lincoln was one of the most progressive presidents to ever serve in off. He created a movement that began to change the way slavery was looked at in the United. States. Every aspect of the monument continues the theme of power and prestige. </p>
<p>        The last monument I looked at, the District of Columbia War Memorial, I found by accident. The memorial commemorates the citizens of the District of Columbia who served in World War I. The memorial is located in West Potomac Park slightly off of Independence Avenue in a grove of trees.  The design is very similar to both the Lincoln and Jefferson monuments, with giant pillars, “higher spaces”, and Symmetry. I think of the three monuments, this one was the most important. Very few people have every heard of the memorial or even know where it is located. Nevertheless, the memorial still adhered to the classic Roman style. Since the memorial commemorates the soldiers from D.C. who faugh in World War I, I thought it was closest to the military battles fought by the Roman Empire. Just as gladiators and commanders were glorified in Roman times, the D.C. War Memorial commemorates the soldiers who fought for us. </p>
<p>        Many people dispute the assumption that the United States and the Roman Empire are similar. Regardless of the debate, looking at the structure of the buildings in D.C., suggests the U.S. is trying to emulate the former world power. The United States wants to be seen as a great nation, and what better way to be seen as great, than imitate the Roman Empire. A famous quote by Charles Caleb Colton explains best the United States’ actions best; “Imitation is the sincerest of flattery.” </p>

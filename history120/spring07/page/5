				<small>March 8th, 2007 <!-- by shwanga --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>          “Cold Mountain” takes place during the Civil War in North Carolina when the men living in this area are rushed to join the Confederate Army. This movie portrays Ada’s, a woman who falls in love with Inman, perspective on the war while waiting for her love’s return. She continues writing letters to him while he is fighting, but he doesn’t respond back to her. <strong>“Cold Mountain” shows a great historical interpretation of the Civil War because it illustrates the struggle and terror the civilians had to overcome to survive by portraying Inman as a man of strength and heroism.</strong></p>
<p>          One of the ways this movie illustrates a historical interpretation is by interpreting the word “masculinity” without agreeing with society’s perspective on men. In other words, unlike most movies where men need to be shown masculine in order to be perceived as powerful or worthy, Inman is shown to be courageous because he struggles to survive. Inman shows heroism twice in this movie when he risks his life trying to save two of his fellow companions fighting in the war. He gets shot once when he tries to save his friend who had already died. In this way, Inman is illustrated as a caretaker who is compassionate for others. He is shown vulnerable because he is alone, homeless and hungry. He begs for shelter, depicting the role of manhood society stresses.</p>
<p>          Because “Cold Mountain” also illustrates a love story, this movie helps viewers to side with Inman’s survival so that he could return to Ada. Inman’s humble personality to care for others makes the audience believe that the confederates are unfortunate people in an unfortunate circumstance seeing they have no choice. Furthermore, the movie shows run-aways as traitors so their families are put to suffering. For example, in a particular scene when one of the men who escaped was found, they killed the man’s family and tormented his mom by tying her hands onto a log and stomping on it. Scenes such as these make the audience feel great sympathy for those dragged into the war. This scene also signifies a historical sense of how people in the same confederate sides could go against each other, so it was hard to trust anyone.</p>
<p>          I feel this movie does not necessarily show which army is the good or bad side. Although it shows Inman’s heroism, he does not account for the rest of the Confederate army. Like the previous example, people in the same army found quarrels amongst themselves finding traitors instead of helping each other. The people in Cold Mountain who are forced into this battle are shown with the most struggles, therefore viewers will sympathize for them. To make us sympathize, there are many brutal clips of these innocent men crying in agonizing pain when wounded. Their rivals in the Union army are not completely shown as horrible people. In a particular scene when Inman is searching for shelter he is welcomed by a mother who provides him with hospitality. When the Union army came into the home looking for food, one of the men in the troop raped the mother, but the other man tried to help the baby from being cold. This scene is shown to prove how not all people fighting for the Union army were horrible people. Thus, there is no right or good side portrayed in this movie. All the people during this time in the Civil War were just struggling to survive, struggling to return back to their families, struggling because of hunger; they were all in the same circumstance. Traitors were most likely caught and dawned with revenge.</p>
<p>          In conclusion, “Cold Mountain” portrays the time of the Civil War in a historical and realistic sense. It shows graphical scenes of men constantly fighting in gruesome wars, and families awaiting their loved ones for a safe return back home. This movie is realistic in that it shows the struggle for Inman and Ada; a struggle for a solider forced into the war and a struggle for a women at home. For instance, she is trying to cope living on her own after her father’s death with Inman gone. It was interesting how the movie did such a great job in portraying how everyone during this era was bound to suffer. The truth didn’t seem “bent” at all, I do not believe this movie is particularly stressing which side was good or bad, nor making any dramatic adjustments to what really happened during this time. “Cold Mountain” does a phenomenal job in illustrating that a man can still be honorable even though he shows vulnerability.</p>

				<h2><a href="/courses/history120/spring07/malcolm-x-movie-review.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Malcolm X - Movie Review">Malcolm X - Movie Review</a></h2>
				<small>March 8th, 2007 <!-- by fyousuf --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><strong>     The movie Malcolm X does an excellent job of portraying the story of Malcolm X, also known as El Hajj Malik El Shabbaz, during one of the most turbulent times in America’s history. </strong>The movie is based upon the true events surrounding the life of Malcolm X. During his lifetime, Malcolm went through many drastic changes in the way he thought and what he preached, going from one extreme to a more moderate view. He was raised in a society that hated people of a darker color. He was a bright student who aspired to become a lawyer, but had his dreams shot down by a teacher who said his color would be a big obstacle for him to overcome. Malcolm’s life spun into turmoil and trips to jail became normal for him. While in jail, Malcolm was introduced to a new movement taking shape in the African American society. This movement was called The Nation of Islam. It preached black supremacy and an extreme hatred for the white man. Malcolm got involved in the Nation of Islam and rose in their ranks. He became an advocate for The Nation of Islam, but eventually found corruption in it and broke from the organization. After a pilgrimage to the city of Mecca, Malcolm’s views changed to Orthodox Islam. He began to preach tolerance for peoples of all races and did not fear for his own life. He knew that many people wanted him dead due to his outlook. Malcolm was assassinated at the hands of the Nation of Islam, having lived only a handful of years.</p>
<p>     The movie’s overall purpose is to portray a very accurate description of the story of a controversial character of history. It follows Malcolm’s life from childhood to his death and does an excellent job of getting the story across. The movie also serves the purpose of educating the public of the chaotic times America lived through. This movie helps in showing what certain beliefs and ideas can lead to. It shows how a people who were looked down upon, ridiculed and killed were feeling and how racism can lead to an equal amount of hatred and tension. This time of history should never be lived through again be any people no matter where they are in the world. Using the story of a famous historical figure that lived through this time and had a great impact on society is much more effective than using a fictional character. Audiences can relate or understand history much better when it is seen through the eyes of someone who actually lived through it.</p>
<p>     The director, Spike Lee, portrays the life of Malcolm as accurately as possible. He does an excellent job of cramming 39 years of anxiety and confusion into three short hours. The point of view used is as if you yourself were there. An example of this would be the assassination scene at the end of the movie. The view and angles make you feel as if you are experiencing the assassination in front of your eyes. The reaction of the people and his wife are very realistic and impressive. The director wanted to make it realistic so that the audience would be able to understand and comprehend who Malcolm X really was and the great impact he made in American history. He wanted to portray what Malcolm X stood for, what his ideas were, and he wanted to show for what reasons this great man was assasinated so that the American public can appreciate who he was.</p>
<p>     At the end of the movie, the narrator claims that Malcolm was not afraid to die because he loved his people, however after reading Malcolm’s letter he wrote back home while in Mecca proves other wise. Spike Lee seems to be implying at the end that Malcolm is still supporting the Black Nationalist movement, however in his letter he says, “But on this pilgrimage, what I have seen, and experienced, has forced me to re-arrange much of my thought patterns previously held, and to toss aside some of my previous conclusions.” He also says, “I have never before seen sincere and true brotherhood practiced by all colors together, irrespective of their color.” These two quotes show that Malcolm became an advocate for Islam during the last years of his life, he tossed aside his pervious conclusions. You can see that he is advocating Islam in another quote from the letter, “if white Americans could accept the Oneness of God, then perhaps, too, they could accept in reality the Oneness of Man…”</p>
<p>     This movie seems to be aimed at a variety of audiences. It can be intended for youth who are going through hard times in their life, due to the fact that Malcolm went through many turbulent times in his life, which even led him to jail. The movie also seemed to be aimed at generations who lived through this time and would like to see an accurate description of what happened. This movie could also be aimed at Muslim people because Malcolm X became a famous caller to the true message of Islam and thus he became someone who the Muslims should learn and know about. He became a part of Islamic history in a way because of his beliefs as a true Muslim who wanted to spread the message of Islam to all people. Since he became a part of the history of Muslims, then Muslims should want to learn about his life. Non-Muslims could also learn a lot from this film, they could learn the trials and tribulations that Malcolm X faced in his life and how at the end he came out on top by accepting the pure message of Islam. People who disliked Malcolm X might dislike him due to misleading and false facts about him. But if they were to watch this film then they could really understand Malcolm&#8217;s life and clear up their misunderstandings.</p>
<p>     Of course, this movie would also be enjoyed by history buffs, who would want to compare the movie to the reality of the situation at the time. This film is a mix of two genres. It is a drama but at the same time it is a documentary of sorts. Spike Lee tries very hard to capture the feeling and passion of the life of Malcolm X. This movie does not talk about Malcolm’s personal issues and problems and much as it displays Malcolm’s role in the society. The character is portrayed very well by Denzel Washington. His acting is exceptional and he follows through with the part beautifully. Therefore, the movie Malcolm X, directed by Spike Lee, does a good job of portraying events that took place that brought Malcolm to his final conclusion.</p>

					<p>I saw the movie Jarhead and it was a movie about a marine who goes through extensive training and then is shipped out to the first Gulf war to protect the oil from the Iraqis.  <strong>History is always interpreted differently by everyone while using the author’s views where he/she could leave out some parts.  </strong><br />
This movie has a classical example of how the author, but in this case the producer only focused on his views about the situation.  While watching the movie I was only able to see American soldiers through out the movie.  As stated in history there were twelve other countries that sent out forces to Kuwait to protect the oil.  This piece of history was not shown in the movie and they could have had many reasons, one that I think is that the producer wanted to focus on the American troops only. <br />
By doing this the producer Sam Mendes does a fantastic job by only focusing on the Americans, so this way there is no confusion and he could go in-depth with the troop members.  While talking about the American troops he focuses on Jamie Foxx’s troops so this way there are only a few characters to focus on while staying on the bigger picture of war.  By telling us stories about each soldier, it plays a huge impact on the viewer’s emotions and feelings.  While doing this he does cut out the part where shooting and death occurred in the war but this was cut out because the few soldiers that he focused on never experienced any of those situations.  This is a yet another example of how the producer only shot scenes from his point of view.<br />
Another reason the producer puts only certain scenes in the movie while producing the movie is because of box office numbers.  This also brings up another point about who the movie was made for in other words the audience.  In this case the movies ratings came out to “R” this is because of pervasive language, some violent images and strong sexual content.  This automatically only admits 18+ unless their parents buy the tickets.  Violence made this movie R rated and may be the language that was used in the movie makes it R.  So the audiences were picked right since little kids don’t have any interest in those sorts of movies about war and violence.  The producer keeps his promise about violence because there is one scene which was really moving for the audience.  This was when Jake was walking around in the desert and finds a huge spot where there had been a biochemical attack and everything was burned down to the ground.  The scene had a huge impact on me and the producer put a little spin to get more emotions out when Jake threw up because of what he saw.  Another scene was where it rained oil and how the troops had to sleep through it. <br />
This was a drama movie since it talked about a war and it always kept the audience on their feet because it could be the last time that soldier was breathing.  This was an excellent movie since it had history facts and a story to follow it.  This is all because of the producer, who only put his views into the movie because if it was only history facts it would have been classified as a boring movie and not done really well in the box office.<br />

				<small>March 8th, 2007 <!-- by mkimq --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>History is studded with tales of great men who have achieved their enviable status. Some of these leaders have been excellent military leaders who have led their armies to the great victories. However, the total personality and distinctive behavioral traits of such men are not covered by historians  in some cases. One such military leader is Alexander of Macedonia. Historians have depicted Alexander’s life, relationship, and achievement as he conquered most parts of the civilized world before he died. <strong>The film “Alexander” sought to unveil the “real Alexander,” one who was not an immortal legend, but a normal human being who was subject to human desires, temptations and influences of others. </strong></p>
<p>The film began with a line borrowed from ‘The Aeneid’: “Fortune favors the bold.” The bold was exactly what “Alexander” turned out to be. The film took a bold and unheard of look at the life, relationships and achievements of one of history’s most charismatic leaders. “Alexander” can be classified as a drama, and more specifically as a biographical epic. The film aimed at a modern, civilized audience who will understand and appreciate an insight into the life of a great man in his ancient world habitat, its cities, people, armies and culture. Judging from the achievement of the film, the film had appealed to an international audience. “Alexander” did a commendable job capturing the entire life history of Alexander, from his youth to his obscure death, from his confusing relationship with his parents, and his jealous mother Olympias, to the enthusiastic bonds with his closest companions and his huge army. The historian Ptolemy narrated details of Alexander’s life that were not filmed, while Aristotle related the chronology of events.</p>
<p>“Alexander” attained the greatest level of historical accuracy by creating thousands of historically accurate dress and recreating the ancient world of Alexander. Also, armor specialist forged a huge collection of shields, helmets, swords, lances, bows and arrows. Especially, Alexander’s  double-plumed lion’s head helmet was impressive. Moreover, realism was instilled in the battle scenes drenched in bloodthirsty pomp. Graphic footage used in film depicted reality, too. Examples are the breathtaking aerial shot of the battle of Gaugamela between Alexander’s army and Persian troops, and the final vicious battle between Alexander’s army and Indian soldiers.</p>
<p>In keeping with movie’s premier aim to give audience a new insight into Alexander’s personality, the film dared to “bend” history in several places. The most important is Alexander being depicted as bisexual. Largely due to the advice of his father, Alexander perceived women as only required for the childbearing function. Obsessed with the ancient Greek warrior Achilles and his male lover Patroclus, Alexander preferred the after-hours company of men, particularly Hephaistion. The film depicted Alexander’s homoerotic love for Hephaistion. He professed his love to the extent of confessing, “I’m nothing without you.” There was no scene they actually kissed. However, their nuzzling head, chaste bear hugs, and soulful looks all served to point their love. Their sexual relationship was teased throughout the film.</p>
<p>The second “history bending” instance is the depiction of Alexander. Very unlike an expected stern hero who can do no wrong, Alexander was often moist-eyed and confused by events, especially those caused by his parents who use their son as leverage against the other. Philip warned his son that all women are evil, while Olympias insisted that Alexander was actually the son of God Zeus and not the Philip. Alexander witnessed Philip raping Olympias when he was a child. It made Alexander acted in similar vein. He raped his feisty Barbarian wife Roxane. Alexander was totally dominated by his adoring and ambitious mother. Much of his lust for power was credited to mother’s influence. She manipulated her son’s psychic strings, motivating and monitoring his activities even when hundreds of miles distant. Her influence even dictated Alexander’s wife choice.</p>
<p>The last “history-bending” consists of adding scenes that are not contained in Alexander’s historical records. These include Alexander’s athletic love foreplay with a naked Roxane, the rape scenes, and the homoerotic interchanges between Alexander and Hephaistion.</p>
<p>When compared to recorded historical event, the film raised many controversies. Iranian historians claimed many parts are historically incorrect. Firstly, Persians soldiers were shown undisciplined and not wearing uniforms in the movie, but in fact, they were very organized. Secondly, Alexander was shown defeating the Persian in a single battle, but in fact, he had to fight several battles before overcoming the Persian army. Scenes involving India too, such as the portrayal of Indian dresses, culture and idiosyncrasies, were totally inaccurate. Moreover, Muslim religious influences were shown in the movie was inaccurate. Islam had not yet been born at that time. The last controversy involves Alexander’s bisexuality - something most Greeks bitterly resent.</p>
<p>While Alexander’s legendary exploits have reverberated through history, he now re-lives in the film “Alexander.” Alexander is not only as a complex and charismatic leader who nearly conquered the whole world, but also as a realistic, much more understandable human being. By doing this, the film enables viewers to develop a deeper understanding into the personality of this legendary hero.</p>

				<small>March 8th, 2007 <!-- by ralsult1 --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The movie “Glory” is about the 54<sup>th</sup> Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry: it was made mostly of Blacks whether they were free blacks from the North or run away slaves from the South. It is told from the view of and follows the story of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw and leads up to the Battle of Fort Wagner at Charleston, South Carolina, on July 18, 1863.  <strong>The purpose of this movie is to demonstrate different aspects of the Civil War, including highlighting the much ignored role of blacks during the war, the racial inequalities present on both sides of the war, as well as displaying the true bravery, courage, and determination not by the soldiers, but of also the men who believed in themselves and their cause. </strong>The movie is mostly based on letters written by Colonel Shaw during the civil war.<br />
Most of the information given to us bout the civil war in history classes or history books gives us the white perspective and the general civil war, this movie gave us the black perspective and highlighted their role in the war, something that is ignored by everyone else. It uses history to tell us the story of the Black men in the 54<sup>th</sup> regiment, and it does so with many details and tells us the story very accurately.  From the declaration that was set at the beginning of the movie that said “ any black man taken prisoner by the Union uniform will be primarily executed” to the decrease in their monthly wage in comparison to a white soldier ($13 to $10), we were shown how exactly they had been suffering from the very beginning and being treated unfairly. It showed how the colored men really wanted to accomplish something and how they wanted to prove themselves even though it eventually took them dying that changed everybody’s impression about them. For example when they found out that they could be executed or slaved if they were caught, they had the choice to either flee or stay, but to the colonel’s surprise not one of them had left by the next morning. Also when they found out that their wage was less than the white soldiers they said “black men take a bullet just like white men do” and then they started ripping up their papers to prove to everybody that they were not in it just to get the money but to also make a point.</p>
<p>For the main part, Glory is historically accurate. It looks like a great deal of effort went into getting most of the details correct. The main events that took place at that time are shown exactly as they were and the main characters were all real. Some of the other characters might not have been though, but were put just to emphasize the role of a black soldier to us. For example Thomas, who was Colonel Shaw’s friend before they went into war, is very fictional. It is said that he is the character that most probably resembles William Carney, who was the first black soldier to receive the Medal of Honor, but it is still a stretch. William Carney was an ex-slave while Thomas was a freeborn Bostonian. Seeing him get wounded and still want to fight further with Colonel Shaw instead of going back to Boston, and then picking up the flag at the battle when he is still wounded leaves an effect on us as, which is why it was ment to be there. We connected with him and felt bad for him at all the right parts of the movie and that was just a small fraction of what the black soldiers had to go through. The same thing is done with the character of Private Trip, he is a troubled black man and they show us how he ran off to get shoes which caused him to get whipped, which is the punishment for such a thing. But, something touched the Colonel when he saw the whips on his back that he had gotten previously and when he talked to a fellow black soldier he knew they had needed the shoes that he had been asking for a while and not getting, of course because his regiment was black. He then goes to the place where they supply regiments with things they need and fought a white man. There is nothing in articles or websites that tell us that happened but it adds to the sense of connection that Shaw had with his regiment and how he was different from Colonel Montgomery (who also had a black regiment, but used them to burn towns down and steal from people). It is said that the movie is based of the letters from Colonel Shaw, so maybe heroes made in the movie are based on some characters that Shaw had talked about in his letters. They also show us how the black army was not intended to be used for battle first but only manual labor, and how still they did not give up. They worked their labor but when it came time for their battle they put their all into it and died trying to help their country.<br />
Glory is a historical war film; it is made for anyone who’s interested in civil war historical movies or African American pride or etc. It brings the period of the Civil War to life and allows us to emotionally connect with the characters and the respective scenes they are associated with, via their effective performances, costumes, and staging of the various battles. Because of this, we feel for the soldiers on a greater emotional level because unlike other historical war movies, this movie gives connection and humanity a greater priority towards the audience rather than strategy, epic battle action, and blood and gore.</p>

					<p>Forrest Gump: One Man Changes History…about 11 times<br />
Forrest Gump, the Academy Award winning movie, is by far one of the most intelligent and intriguing movies ever made about 20<sup>th</sup> century history. Taken from a personal view point rather than an overview, Forrest Gump traces the experiences of one man who always seems to find himself blissfully unaware of his constant presence at some of America’s most significant historical events throughout the 1960’s, 70’s, and 80’s. From his medal-worthy Vietnam endeavors until the birth of his first son, <strong>Forrest <u>Gump </u>provides an intelligent view of American History’s most important events as a backdrop to a colorful biography.<br />
</strong>Gump’s first major experience is playing college football for the University of Alabama. This is historically significant because at the time in which this took place, college football was a true Americana-type accomplishment. Gump’s football acted as a catalyst for his meeting the President. One of the most hilarious scenes is Gump’s lack of awareness at the importance of the president when he decides to say on national television that he “has to pee.” Director Robert Zemeckis creates a true nostalgic feel by blending actual footage of President John. F. Kennedy which has been modified to include Forrest as a member of the guests.<br />
On his graduation from the University of Alabama, Gump is recruited into the army in order to fight in the Vietnam War. The Vietnam War was not only one of the biggest political hot-buttons of the 60’s, but perhaps one of the greatest in America’s history. The Vietnam War was fought primarily on the basis of protecting America’s overseas interests and protecting America’s way of life overseas. The Vietnam War was also responsible for one of the biggest reaction groups, known as hippies. Hippies were just a small microcosm of large groups who constantly protested the Government’s decision to remain in Vietnam. Gump, highly regarded medal-of-honor recipient somehow gets caught amongst a protest rally, once again, blissfully unaware. Mistaking him for someone speaking against the war, the hippies allow him to speak on the war in front of the reflecting pool. However, none of these hippies are able to hear what he says because of audio problems.<br />
Although throughout Forrest’s life, he is constantly experiencing incredible memories as viewed by the audience. But due to his mental capacity, he often does not realize the level of the importance of the moments going on around him. HE foregoes the fact that he is selected to visit communist China as a life crowning moment. Winning the Medal of Honor, something very few people have ever done, is not the greatest moment of his life. To him, the greatest part of his life is marrying Jenny and being a father.  According to Forrest, He is “not a smart man” but he knows what love is. And in the face of his incredible life, that’s all that ever mattered to him.<br />
For risk of this becoming a simple summary, it is important to discuss why Forrest Gump is such as success. Although Forrest Gump is full of history that defined America, its historical accuracy is far off. But, that’s the point. Rather than stick to cut-and-dry facts of history, i.e. who was responsible for breaking open the Watergate scandal, Forrest Gump provides more of a “what-if-it-happened-like-this” type feel. For example: What if Forrest Gump was responsible for the exposing of Watergate and the subsequent decline of Richard Nixon’s presidency. What if Forrest was responsible for creating one of the worlds’ most recognizable and marketable symbols; the smiley face? And what if he created it by accident? Clearly, none of these historical events happened in this manner. By avoiding facts, and creating human interest blended with historical events, Forrest Gump proves to be a cinematic masterpiece filled with drama, and love in which the history that makes it so great has really no effect on the character.</p>

					<p>     When considering historical movies, there are many aspects that effect how the history is portrayed. One of the most influential aspects that effect the portrayal of history is the need to satisfy the audience that is being targeted. Since the goal of big budget blockbusters such as <em>Gladiator</em> is to make as much money as possible, the movie must appeal to a wide range of viewers, and therefore must be careful with the delicate balance between factual accuracy and entertainment. There are those who want to be entertained regardless of whether it is true, which comprise the majority of people in this day in age, and there are those who believe that historical accuracy should not be compromised for the sake of entertainment. In order to satisfy both of these audiences, the filmmakers of <em>Gladiator</em> must consider their stylistic approach, the point of view in which the story is told, and the historical accuracy of the film, which in turn all effect how the history of Rome is portrayed. </p>
<p>     The movie, <em>Gladiator</em> (directed by Ridley Scott), begins when Maximus (Russell Crowe), who is one of Rome’s greatest generals, wishes to return home to his family after a grueling victory over the Germanic barbarians. But contrary to his wishes, Maximus’ father figure and current Emperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius, tells him that he has been chosen to be the next Emperor in place of the actual heir, Commodus. Aurelius believes that Commodus is not fit to be the protector of Rome, nor will he fulfill his wishes to turn Rome back into a Republic. Upon being informed that Maximus will take the throne, Commodus murders his father Marcus Aurelius, and then orders his men to execute Maximus. Maximus escapes death only to be captured to become a slave, and later traded to become a Gladiator. From here, Maximus rises amongst the ranks of gladiators, and as his master’s wealth grows, he finds himself fighting in Rome’s Coliseum before Commodus himself. Finally, after many perilous struggles, Maximus has a showdown with Commodus in which he has the chance to revenge the death of Marcus Aurelius and set his dying wishes for a Republic in motion. </p>
<p>     Since a major goal of this movie is to appeal to a large audience, a lot of focus needs to be put on making its style entertaining. Using the fascinating setting of Rome, <em>Gladiator</em> is incredibly pleasing to the eye. The cinematography in this film is breathtaking, specifically the digitally rendered backdrops of ancient Rome and its Coliseum, which provides the audience with a satisfying and almost magical impression of the Rome that would make one wish to have witnessed it first hand. The most memorable scene in which Rome is digitally interpreted, is when Commodus considers the fate of his sister while on his balcony that looks over the vibrant and massive city. In this scene, as well as several others, historical records and current artifacts are used to recreate ancient Rome in a glorified way. In doing so, the way in which Rome is portrayed emphasizes its strength and greatness.  Also, by making interpretations using some factual basis, the producers are able to stun both those who are simply seeking entertainment as well as those who are intrigued by the history of ancient Rome.</p>
<p>     In another attempt to grab the interest of mass viewers and those of us with short attention spans, <em>Gladiator</em> is comprised mostly of action sequences.  Because the special effects, as well as the acting by Russell Crowe (Maximus), were so impressive, the Roman army seemed to be as powerful as I previously envisioned it to be. Even in Maximus’ battles as a gladiator, his heroic victories represented the strength and composure of the Roman Army that he had previously commanded. Also, as a consequence for having more action, there is a limited amount of dialogue throughout the film. While many past movies about Rome are heavy in dialogue often considered hard to follow, this was the filmmaker’s decision to make it possible for almost everyone to understand without it being boring. </p>
<p>     Another interesting aspect of <em>Gladiator</em> is that it is told from several points of view as Maximus is reduced from a high-ranking general to a gladiator. This is unique because most movies about ancient Rome are portrayed from one point of view, usually the emperor’s. This is appealing to a large audience not only because people think unique is good, but also because people have the tendency to love the underdog. In the beginning of the film, we are able to see through the viewpoint of Maximus as a general, where the majority of characters are used simply as tools to create an epic battle scene. Here, the only characters that matter are the people in power, which allow us to appreciate the combat strategies and sheer power of the Roman Army. By having Maximus lose his commanding power, we are able to gain some insight on what the lives of ancient Roman slaves and gladiators were like, mainly through Maximus’ interactions with Juba, a fellow slave and gladiator. Juba was introduced into the film by helping Maximus with a wound, and as the film proceeded, Juba shared his personal emotions about his love for his family. By portraying the movie from point of view of Maximus as a slave, not only are we able to realize that slaves too have feelings and loved ones, but we are also able to see the flaws of the Roman culture by witnessing the agony that slaves and gladiators were put through. From these two points of view alone, two sides of the history of Rome are portrayed. On the other end of the spectrum, in some scenes we are able to look through the eyes of Commodus, the emperor who only saw slaves as money and gladiators as entertainment. But, having previously experienced the point of view of the gladiators, we, the audience, have their sympathy and are able to recognize that Commodus’ view is an evil one. Essentially, by experiencing the point of view of the slaves/gladiators, the audience was able to recognize the flaws of Commodus. This is important because even though Rome visually appears to be impeccable, the movie is able to portray the historical truth that Marcus Aurelius was the last of the “five good emperors”, while the deranged Commodus scandalized Roman society. </p>
<p>     In addition to the appealing stylistic elements and interesting points of view, there are many historically inaccurate elements to this movie. They may not be very good for attracting and pleasing history buffs, but these inaccuracies enhance the dramatic story line of the film, which is satisfying to the masses of people seeking entertainment. One example of this is that although his son Commodus was with him at the time of his death, Commodus never murdered Marcus Aurelius in order to seize the throne. In fact, Aurelius, who died in 180AD, named Commodus Caesar in 166 and made him co-emperor in 177. Although this may be a deterrent to history buffs, the revenge that that Maximus seeks would have been significantly less personal and/or meaningful. Commodus murdering Marcus Aurelius was the point at which Commodus was defined as the evil character, and the point at which the audience was given a reason to want Maximus to succeed in his revenge. </p>
<p>     Another historical deviation occurred during the beginning of the movie when Maximus’ forces were at battle with the Germanic Tribes. The way in which the Roman Legionnaires abandoned their formation to engage in Hollywood friendly one-on-one standoffs is historically inaccurate in that they would never do this unless retreating. Historically, the way that the legionnaires stuck together, holding formation and aligning their shields to create barriers was what made them so successful in combat. In a one-on-one battle against a Germanic barbarian, the barbarian would almost certainly be the victor. The creators of the movie decided to make this battle scene less historically accurate with the intent to make it more entertaining to watch, and therefore attract a larger viewer audience. Even though the history of Rome was bent in some instances, the movie was nonetheless successful in portraying the overall essence of the time period. </p>
<p>     As one can see, in pursuing the goal of <em>Gladiator</em>, which was to appeal to the largest audience possible, many decisions were made that effected how the history of Rome was portrayed. The most important of these decisions were in regards to the stylistic approach, the point of view in which the story is told, and the historical accuracy. Yet, these are not the only elements of the film that define how the ancient Roman history was portrayed, and although appealing to the masses was a higher priority than appealing to our fellow history buffs, the end result of <em>Gladiator</em> was a wonderful story that portrayed the time period very well.  For those who are looking to learn the hard facts about ancient Rome’s history, I suggest that you rely on sources other than this film. With that being said, for the rest of you who are willing to accept a few historical inaccuracies for the sake of entertainment, I highly recommend that you watch this movie.  </p>

					<p align="center">Movie Review -Schindler’s List</p>
<p>Schindler’s List, directed by Steven Spielberg in 1993 and based on <em>Schindler’s Ark </em>written by Thomas Keneally. <strong>Is based on the true story of Oskar Schindler, a Nazi Czech, who uses cheap Jewish labor to make his fortune in WW2, but is changes his motives and saves over 1000 Polish Jews from execution. </strong>Schindler’s List is based on the Holocaust in the 1940’s where Jewish followers were killed off just because of their faith to Judaism. Not only were Jewish people targeted but the gypsies and disabled as well. On May 9<sup>th</sup>,1945 the Nazis surrendered, killing 9-18 million people.</p>
<p>The purpose of the movie was to educate the younger generation on how brutal the Holocaust was and to still provide a voice to the millions of people who died. It also showed that people did try to help and not everyone was bad, example Oskar Schindler. At first he was greedy and wanted fortune with hiring the Jews, but soon realized how much he could help and turned around and saved over 1000 people. I thought that it was very accurate to history and used it to its advantage. It even was in black and white to give it more of an effect.</p>
<p>I think this movie was intended for the younger generation that did not experience this and it was starting to become more of a history topic than a topic that needed to be remembered. I honestly think that if we didn’t have history to guide us, after 9-11 maybe something like this would of happened to Muslim people living in America? History will always repeat itself but it is up to the people to make sure that the bad doesn’t repeat itself.</p>
<p>The style of this movie was a Historical Drama with a little romance thrown in. I thought it was a good idea for this movie to be in the category drama so the audience could relate to the character more. I thought that having the movie in black and white with some color in certain places like the little girls coat gave it more life ironically.</p>
<p>Schindler’s List was a movie to show the lives of the millions of Jew that were killed because of their religion. I thought that this movie was very close to capturing life and keeping it strong in our hearts.</p>

					<p>      Movies are just one avenue people use to escape from the everyday grind of their lives and just sit back and relax. Movies that are factual based give people of today the opportunity to understand how life was in historical times without actually being part of it. For example, movies about such events as the Great Depression, times of war, and tragedy such as the sinking of the Titanic help us understand how people coped and reacted during times of great challenges. Cinderella Man, for instance, is a movie that took place during one of the darkest times that America has faced and how one man rose to the occasion and made a life better for everybody came in contact with. Jim Braddock, a once promising boxer is forced into retirement after a couple of key losses. Entering the darkest times of the Great Depression, Braddock luckily gets a job working at the docks to support his family. Thanks to a last minute cancellation, Braddock is given a one time and one time only fight against the number two light heavyweight boxer in the world. In contrast to everyone expecting Braddock to lose in the first round, he beats all the odds and knocks his opponent out shocking the nation. This win and subsequent others gets Braddock a title shot against Max Bear, the heavyweight champion of the world. Not listening to the advice of his friends, kids, or even his wife, Jim Braddock undergoes one of the most painful fights he has ever faced. In the end, even though he was badly beaten, he was named the heavyweight champion of the world. <strong>&#8220;Cinderella Man&#8221; is a feel good movie that depicts America during the great depression and how one man&#8217;s endurance, integrity and family values overcame insurmountable odds</strong>.<br />
      Cinderella Man does an excellent job of depicting what life was like during the Great Depression. It shows us that under extreme hardships and bumpy times, there’s always good that can come from it. The message of the film is that no matter how tough things appear to be, if you keep a positive attitude and keep trying, eventually good will come out of it. In the movie, Jim Braddock describes this attitude clearly when he says, “I have to believe that when things get bad, we can do something about it.” Fighting with a broken arm, giving the small amount of food he had to his children, and working on the dock’s in danger of getting injured all were sacrifices that Jim Braddock didn’t have to take, but took it anyway to support his family and their needs. The times of the Great Depression were extremely tough and even though Jim Braddock had thousands of reasons to give up and die, he kept fighting and eventually got rewarded for it. As the movie went on you could tell the rewards he was granted. The beginning of the movie gave us great examples of how rough the times were. Their house was really small with only a bed or two, they ate one piece of ham for their meal with watered down milk, and they even stole wood from fences to make fires. It got so hard that Jim actually went onto welfare for money so he could get the electricity turned on and his kids back. The movie did such an excellent job of putting the audience in the moment, that you almost felt guilty sitting there eating popcorn and drinking soda while watching Braddock’s family eat very little. As the movie progressed, and Jim made some money, you could see how the times got better. The electricity was turned back on, they had full meals, and Jim even had money to buy his wife flowers.<br />
      The biggest choice that this movie made was to show how bad the Great Depression was and how people had to overcome adversity. They chose to make Braddock live in a very dark and dismal building with no education and a rough and tough personality. They made his manager look like a non-caring person who only thought about himself. This was demonstrated when the manager was making Braddock fight even though he was hurt, he kept pushing him to fight, and even was a big influence on him to fight Max Bear. They chose him to work at the Dock’s to show how hard it was to get a job and to get money in these times. They could’ve shown this movie in a thousand different ways, but they decided to show how bad the Great Depression actually was through the many details it showed us. The movie also did an excellent job of showing the great disparity that was apparent during this time between the rich and poor.<br />
      This action packed dramatic film is intended for anybody who has ever heard about or lived through the Great Depression in America. Many people who have ancestors that lived through the Great Depression get a good look at what actually occurred during those times. People who learn about the Great Depression in school can watch this movie and relate to it as well. This movie is very accurate to the details and styles of that era. The clothes, old cars, beat up boxing gloves, and boxing ring excellently portrayed the time period. Although this movie falls into the boxing genre like a Million Dollar Baby and Rocky, it was able focus more on the struggles of John Braddock and the times then on boxing. During one of his interviews, Jim Braddock stated, “this time I know what I’m fighting for.” Even though he said he was fighting for milk, he was also fighting for our nation and the people who had suffered through the Great Depression. He was fighting for everything he believed in and I believe that was the main reason he took the fight that potentially could have ended his life. <br />
      Although the movie was very accurate conveying both how the people looked and survived during the great depression, it did take some liberties with details. An example of this is how the movie depicts Max Bear as killing two people in the ring before the big fight, but many historians, including members of Bear’s family, have stated that the second person did not die as a result of his injuries sustained in the ring. The other scene that could be a stretch on actual events was how Jim and his wife reacted during the party thrown for them before the main fight. It was a very expensive restaurant with many wealthy people in attendance. Jim and his wife were depicted as being able to handle that type of scene when in fact they probably couldn’t have given where they were in the social ladder.</p>
<p>      Cinderella Man was truly a great movie.  The ability for one man to rise a nation in a time of need of desperate need it just remarkable.  Jim Braddock was a hero of all ages and will always be remembered not only as a great boxer, but as a person who changed our nation.  Cinderella Man changed my view on the Great Depression.  At first, I just thought it was a normal thing and America was faced with adversity like we always were.  After watching the movie, I can truly feel how bad the Great Depression was and what the people of their time had to go through.  This movie had the impacts of the Great Depression, while having a marvelous story behind it, which made for one hell of a movie.                                                  </p>

					<p>The Civil War was a very critical event in US history that can be argued was one of the most significant time periods in History.  Since the Civil War, many books and movies have either been written or made to try and present people with, what the magnitude and lifestyle was like during that specific period. Even though many different genres have been made, I am going to look at one and that is the movie “Gods and Generals”. A lot of people think that Gods and Generals is a very factual movie that simply portrays straight historical information.<strong> Gods and Generals is a historical movie that is very factual, but also is produced to have the audience of the movie, feel certain connections towards certain people and groups in the movie.</strong></p>
<p><strong>            </strong>        General “StoneWall” Jackson is a very decorative confederate general. Typically in history, he is known as being very fearless and a bit over the top on the battlefield. In this movie a different side is presented to the audience, even though they still show his fearless nature too. The movie really wants the audience to connect with General Jackson. They do this by showing his religious side all throughout the movie. General Jackson is shown praying to God many times in the movie, one time with his wife in the beginning of the movie before he leaves, another time before the battle at Manassas. This really allows the audience to feel a connection towards a certain character. During the middle of the movie they even show General Jackson growing an attachment to a little girl. They become best of friends and it is probably the most touching scenes throughout the movie. When the little girl dies of Scarlet Fever, General Jackson starts to cry and you can not help, but feel for him. From the beginning of the movie to him being shot and dying from pneumonia at the end this movie really gives you a look at not just a whole bunch of characters, but one specifically that you can have that attachment to. So because a lot of this movie is centered around him, it gives the audience that character that they like to feel for and to sympathize with.</p>
<p>A group that fought in the civil war and played a very big part was the Irish Brigade. The 69<sup>th</sup> New York which was a brigade made up mostly of Irish immigrants. The way they were portrayed in this movie was very heroic. The Irish Brigade is a group that usually gets lost in the Civil War and not a lot of people know about the contribution that they played for the Union army. The only time that the Irish Brigade is seen in the movie is during the battle at Fredericksburg. It seems to be a special part of the movie when the Irish Brigade is marching up towards the confederates facing their fellow countrymen (the Irish on the confederate side) and fighting harder and stronger or being portrayed as fighting harder and stronger then the brigades before them that went. By watching how the movie portrayed the Irish Brigade, being so courageous and fighting for something that they really had nothing to do with. They were immigrants from Ireland that came to America to try escape the same things that were being fought in the Civil War. As an audience member during the Fredericksburg battle you can really see how the Irish Brigade is appreciated in history today. This is a group that the audience can cheer for and feel sympathy for. It is almost like cheering for the underdog. Everyone likes cheering for the underdog and the Irish were the underdog in this movie. Even though the movie shows many other Brigades during the battle, the Irish Brigade is portrayed a notch higher then all of the other ones, just by seeing how the confederate army, their own countrymen take time to notice their effort and give out a cheer for them. Even after the battle a special recognition is given to them in a letter presented to the men that fought in the battle. Even though the Irish is only shown once during the movie, being defeated badly, you can not help, but to appreciate them when the movie is done. So I think only showing the Irish Brigade once and showing them being defeated was a good job by the director of the movie showing off the Irish.</p>
<p>Gods and Generals touches on a lot of different things in the movie. It gives you the historical look that makes it your usually boring history movie, but it also gives you those objects that people look to have that connection with and feel for during the movie. That is what separates this from just a plain historical movie. I would call this a historical drama movie. This is a very accurate historically, but some of the parts were altered, so it wouldn’t be that plain historic movie. The relationship between the little girl and General Jackson, I couldn’t find any information the proved that to be true, so it was just added to contribute to the character of General Jackson. The way the Irish is portrayed is also the way the director of the movie wanted to present them to the audience. So while many may argue that the movie was a disappointment or a complete waste of money to spend on a movie, the movie does a good job of picking certain things to focus the movie around and on to the audience to make it more of a movie that can be watched by not only historians, but also by people that just want to watch a feel good movie like Cold Mountain, just not as extreme as that.</p>

					<p>The Film <u>Gladiator</u>, released in 2000, staring Russell Crowe is on my all-time top favorite movies. I enjoy this action packed movie every time I watch it. For the assignment we had to dig deep in to the historical fiction of the movie. I began with research on several different website relating to the movie and the facts behind its historical events, and what I read was surprising.</p>
<p>            The Movie its self is true in most aspects, except for some small details such as characters and actual events that took place. Obviously the Roman Empire was real, and there were really Gladiators that fought to the death. Although not every fight was to the death, it seemed as if every fight in the movie was. Another false part of the movie was that the main character, Maximus, did not exist at all. He was merely put into the plot to be able to create a heroic character.</p>
<p>            The movie gave a great sense of what ancient Greece was like in 180 AD. The attention to detail of the costumes and the scenery was fantastic; this captured the minds of the audience and put them in the time period. I greatly enjoyed this film because it was entertaining yet, it was based of actual events of an ancient society. I was unable to differentiate the fact from the fiction in the movie until I did the research on this must see movie.</p>

					<p>The movie <u>A Time to Kill</u>, originally produced by writer John Grisham, and as a movie directed by Joel Schumacher, is a story of events taking place in a very southern part of Mississippi. This drama shows an African American girl is raped by two drunk white men, her father realizes these men will probably never be formally charged, so he shoots them. This event ignites all of the racial tensions boiling among the people living in the town. <strong>Through showing the unfair treatment of African Americans even after desegregation, the treatment Matthew McConaughey endures for being a white man as a lawyer to a black man, and the use of the Klu Klux Klan, <u>A Time to Kill</u>, although fictional, offers a powerful depiction of racism and how it is simply cruel and wrong.</strong> This movie should be seen by everyone, although it defiantly more effective in reaching women as it sparks emotional reactions due to family events and unlikely friendships.</p>
<p>This movie is most effective at showing how unfairly African Americans have been historically treated, even in judicial situations, law that should be fair, just wasn’t for them. In the movie, as Carl Lee, the father of the African American girl who was raped, is on trial. There are many indications he will not be tried fairly. First, the jury that will be deciding of his punishment is made up of mostly middle to later aged white members from the town. The people of the jury had the same mindset as many people historically did shortly after segregation, that whites are superior to blacks and they should not be treated equally. Also, the judge who is presiding over the case is an old man who is friends with the brother of one of the men Carl Lee killed, and is also unspokenly known as a supporter of the old ways of the south. When asked for the trial to be relocated to ensure fairness, Carl Lee is denied, as could be expected during that time period, and of a town who would love to see an African American suffer.</p>
<p><u>A Time to Kill</u>, shows the treatment one supporting an African American in a southern belief town, might go through. Matthew McConaughey becomes Carl Lee’s lawyer. As a result the angered white members begin calling his home with death threats to him and his family. At this point the KKK, a white supremacy group who have real existence and are still around today, comes into the picture. A Cross is burned on McConaughey’s front lawn, something a KKK group would sometimes use as a warning to future victims. They eventually blow up McConaughey’s home. This portion of the film, based on historical events can be seen as a possibility in this situation. This is part of the hatred that existed between the North and the South, slavery, were whites really superior?</p>
<p>There are two powerful moments in the movie that prove the color of skin has no difference on who we are. First, there is a man who takes part in the KKK events, but ends up calling and warning the police before things happen. This shows that the man felt that it was wrong, but it also shows the extreme pressure there was for a white male to conform and unite with other white males to defeat the African Americans. The Civil War proved just how much hate and tension non conformity can cause, we went to war against ourselves, partly or I would say mostly, over slavery. There is a scene in the movie that occurs outside of the courtroom that is very symbolic to the Civil War. A massive fight breaks out between the African Americans and the whites standing outside the courtroom, the police are forced to break up the fight, sometimes having to hit and knock out members. Here the police resemble brothers, and at one point one of the deputies protects one of the black members and one of his fellow officers says, “well who the hell’s side are you on?” This moment shows how the police officer who should have represented neutrality had sided. This really can be analogous to the North and South and how divided they were. The second most powerful moment is when McConaughey gives a testimony to the jury. He dramatically tells them to close their eyes and imagine, he goes through the whole scene of the little girl getting raped, at the end he says, “now imagine she was white.” This is when you see that some people have come to the realization that if a black man had raped a white girl, the town would have rejoiced that one less African American was around, and possibly made the generalization that all African Americans are such savages. They also recognize that when considering their own daughters, Carl Lee’s actions were not that shocking. These two elements of the movie give the backbone of how racial tensions are a hate over skin color, and that inside we are all the same.</p>
<p>One of the unrealistic parts of the film is in the end, Carl Lee goes completely free. Being an African American of that time and also, having killed two white men, it is very unlikely that in real life this would have happened. Although if in real life people had actually witnessed these strong testimonies and were open to realizations, which of that time were also probably unlikely, Carl Lee probably would have served a lesser sentencing.</p>
<p>Overall, historically speaking, <u>A Time to Kill</u> shows a powerful depiction of the deep rooted problem that often times divides the United States, racism. In sequence of events it shows how people have gone from deep hate over skin color, to finally coming to the realization that we aren’t that different from our neighbor of a different skin tone. The film really causes you to think about what you would do in the situation Carl Lee would do, would your sudden instincts be that different than his? Also by reflecting on the film, many emotions are revealed such as shame and guilt upon realizing at one point we have probably all felt and experienced some type of racism. The movie promotes our blending, and upon watching has a lasting effect on all those who watch it. <u>A Time to Kill</u>, truly brings out the ignorance in racism and puts those to shame who take part in it.</p>

					<p><strong>Introduction  World War I </strong></p>
<p>World War I had many names, the first world war, the great war, “the war to end all wars.” It was a world wide military conflict of many big nations all through Europe which took place between 1914 to 1918. This war killed millions and left many more separated from families and homes. The countries were divided into two fractions, the Central powers who were trying to take over most of Europe and the Allied powers who were trying to stop this from happening. The Central powers consisted of Germany, Austria-Hungry, and the Ottoman Empire. The Allied powers consisted of United States, France, British  Empire, and Russia. With this war came many new inventions, one being the just recently invented air plane. It didn’t take long for the military to realize that these planes could be utilized as a very useful war weapon. The United   States entered the war late, however there were still many brave Americans coming to volunteer their services all over Europe. One place being France where they had started a fighter squadron for Americans called Lafayette Escadrille.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;FLYBOYS&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>The movie “Flyboys” was a well anticipated movie for fans that enjoy aerial combat and dog fights. <strong>Although this movie had incredible visual effects and outstanding action sequences, it lacked to tell the true story and historical facts of World War I. </strong>The movie had many well known actors to light up the screen and attract fans. Dazzling would be the word I would use to describe the aerial battles that took place as the American pilots fought the Germans high in the sky. The visual effects were great and expected since the same guy directed Independents Day. You could say that the visuals were a little excessive, since smoke trails like missile fire followed the small little bullets from the machine gun. I guess they had no other way for you to follow the bullets to the enemy planes.</p>
</p>
<p>The characters were all given supporting roles with the exception of one, Blain Rawlings played by James Franco. You see the story through his eyes as he deals with dilemmas on the ground and in the air. He must leave his home after defaulting on the payments and having a bench warrant for beating up the banker tried to take his ranch. Blain Rawlings is portrayed as fearless hotshot cowboy looking for thrills. He is a wild man with no respect for authority and does as he pleases. The audience is forced to like him since he is a man who just lost his home and forced to run because of an “evil banker”. History goes to show you this behavior would not be tolerated, as the French ran one of the most rigid outfits in the war. He also leaves the base a number of times to visit the French girl he falls in love with. Again this would not be allowed at war time for a pilot to leave in the middle of a war and visit with his girlfriend. Instead of the movie focusing on the fighter pilots and there missions, much of the movie focused on this love affair.</p>
</p>
<p>Historically speaking there was no information given about the opposition. Only mentioning the Germans and not once mentioning the rest of the Central powers. The purpose for this movie was to allow viewers to see the very first combat fighters in action and to understand the technology that was available to them. I believe Flyboys did not show the movie with correct factual evidence. The plane shown in the movie looked like it was made of fiberglass, nice and spotless with a flawless engine. However history will tell you that the plane was made out mostly metal and wood with really high crash rate. The Germans were portrayed as evil people with so sense of remorse of honor. Most of the Germans were in red planes taking cheep shots and shooting Americans fighter pilots who had ejected or crash landed on the ground. The showed the leader of the enemy as the “Black Falcon”, a brutal commander of the German squadron fighting against the Americans. He was portrayed as ruthless with no mercy, toying with some of the inexperienced pilots letting them know before he would shoot them down. The Black Falcon was symbolized as an evil man flying a terrifying all black plane with more fire power than the Americans. Now this is not a video game where you face the boss at the end of the level, although this movie was shown as if it were. There were no rouge fighter pilots on either side who just flew around shooting down what they saw. These planes had a limited amount of fuel and could fly their missions and hopefully make it back to the base.</p>
</p>
<p>This movie had really good visual effects and I enjoyed the story line. I do not believe it showed factual evidence to support what really happened in the war. The planes were not portrayed correctly, and the enemies shown as heartless butchers. The main character Blain Rawlings was shown as an out of control wild cowboy with no respect to authority. Although this makes the movie more interesting, this would not happen in the French military or any other military. Overall I enjoyed they movie and categorize it as a fiction movie with no relation to the real war.</p>

					<p><strong>A huge part of what history is is finding clues and piecing them together. Especially difficult is figuring out pieces of history from hundreds of years ago. There are always clues that lead to another and lead to another before any real important facts are discovered. </strong>This is exactly what the movie <u>National Treasure</u> is about. In this movie, Ben Gates goes on a hunt to find the infamous treasure that is worth hundreds of billions of dollars that was buried somewhere underneath The Charlotte by the group the Masons. He pieces together the clues that have been passed down through his family since the 1800’s. The first clue is that “it lies beneath The Charlotte.” They are then brought to a clue that is on the back of the Declaration of Independence, which next brings them to the Liberty Bell in New Jersey. They finally find the large treasure underneath a church in a hidden underground room. To make the search even harder, millionaire Ian Howe is trying to beat them to the treasure to claim as his own, even if it means killing anyone that gets in his way.</p>
<p>The overall goal of this movie is to tell the story of a hunt for a treasure that’s worth is inconceivable to even think of. I found it really fascinating the way they turned everyday American symbols into a treasure map. Such as how Gates was able to piece together that the row of numbers hidden on the back of the Declaration of Independence corresponded with a group of letters Benjamin Franklin wrote to a newspaper under the name of Silence Dogood. I really enjoyed this movie because I have always found this type of historical fiction captivating; to today my favorite book still is <em>Angels and Demons</em> which has this same type of hunt.</p>
<p>            <u>National Treasure</u> is shown from the point of view of the main character, Gates. For the most part it follows him on his path to find the mythical treasure. This movie really shows our founding fathers in a good light. The whole reason they buried the treasure in the first place was because they didn’t think any man could handle that amount of wealth, not even a king. I think that this movie could help kids find history even more fascinating than it already is. If an adult like me found this movie to be mesmerizing, I know a kid would probably find it even better. With its rating of PG and being created by  Disney, I think it was intended for all ages and to be a movie to make anyone spellbound by history like so many of us were in our younger age.</p>
<p>            This movie is very much historical fiction; while there are many real historical facts and symbols, I honestly don’t believe that there is a map made of these symbols that lead to a treasure. Although they bent the truth a lot in different scenes, I think they did it for good reasons which led the viewers to think, “what if this really was true.” I googled some of the “facts” from the movie to see if they were completely true, and some of them were. Such as Silence Dogood, who was the first pseudonym that Benjamin Franklin created. This movie helped make history interesting, even if a lot of it was just a story. It was a captivating movie that honestly led me to wanting to learn more about symbols in it. I am excited to have learned there is also going to be a sequel to this movie.<br />

					<p><strong>The film Gladiator creates a story where one Roman, Russel Crowe, goes from being a General of the Roman army to a slave forced to fight as a gladiator. The message of the movie seems to be that you can be on top of the world and have everything taken away from you. Gladiator This film definitely has good depictions of what happened in the arena&#8217;s in ancient Rome, but each arena scene also had some flaws within it.</p>
<p></strong>. The message of the movie seems to be that you can be on top of the world and have everything taken away from you. Gladiator This film definitely has good depictions of what happened in the arena&#8217;s in ancient Rome, but each arena scene also had some flaws within it.In Gladiator, the Roman Emperor&#8217;s son Commodus kills his father in order to gain power. He then orders Crowe&#8217;s character to be executed and his family murdered. Crowe escapes but his family don&#8217;t fair quite as well. When he returns to his home, he finds his family dead. Exhausted and wounded, he lies beside their bodies until some slavers pick him up. The slavers sell him to a man named Proximo who makes Crowe fight in an arena somewhere in the Roman Empire as a gladiator. Proximo brings his gladiators to Rome to fight in the Colosseum to fight in a series of events that Commodus planned. Crowe sees this as his opportunity for revenge. He wins every battle he is put in and defy&#8217;s Commodus in every way he can. In the end, Crowe winds up fighting Commodus in the Colosseum and kills him. Crowe unfortunately dies as well from a previous wound, but dies a hero&#8217;s death.</p>
<p>The gladiator battles occur in two different locations. One is in a simple arena within one of the Roman Empire and the other is in the Coloseum in the heart of Rome. The first battle that you see is in the simple arena. Within this battle several gladiators take on slaves, Crowe is one of these slaves, who are chained together. This scene did not really show how a gladiator battle was fought. Most battles were one on one and between two gladiators. Gladiators were in fact slaves or prisoners of war. Once in a while someone would voluntarily become a gladiator but it was not too common. The way this battle was depicted was that all the gladiators were volunteers and the slaves were just thrown in there to meet their deaths. Perhaps the film was just trying to show slaves overcoming the odds and becoming full-scale gladiators in their hopes to gain their freedom. Regardless of the reasoning behind the choice of how they depicted the scene, it was not historically accurate. One good aspect of this fight scene was that they showed several of the types of gladiators. They showed the Myrmillo which had a helmet with a fish like crest on the top, hoplomachus which carried a shield and a sword, and the retairius who fought with a net and a trident (2). The best scene with historical accuracy was Crowe&#8217;s second battle in the Colosseum. It was a one on one battle with a Dimachaeri which was a gladiator who carried two weapons.</p>
<p>At the end of the battle scenes within the Colosseum, the emperor decided whether the gladiators would live or die. In the first scene, Crowe&#8217;s team of gladiators killed all the other gladiators put up against them. They were then surrounded by troops so the emperor could meet them and decide their fates. He puts his thumb up which meant live. During the second scene in the Colosseum, it is a one on one battle between Crowe and another battle. Crowe defeats his opponent but does not kill him and waits for the emperor to decide the mans fate. The emperor puts his thumb down for death but Crowe defy&#8217;s him and doesn&#8217;t kill the man. The idea behind this is true, however they got the directions wrong. Thumbs down meant live and symbolized putting your sword into the ground while thumbs up meant kill. This is a fairly minor mistake and did not really take away from the historical accuracy of the scenes.</p>
<p>Towards the beginning of the film, Commodus instructs several men to execute Crowe&#8217;s character. The executor is going to just decapitate Crowe, but he asks for &#8220;a clean death, a soldier&#8217;s death.&#8221; It was all just a plot to get away which he did, but what he said was very important. Throughout Gladiator, the idea of dying with honor was very prominent. This was a very important aspect of Roman society. Most Roman&#8217;s did not live past thirty and wanted to pass on with honor. They could go to the arena&#8217;s and watch the gladiators fight and either gain a honorable victory or death (1). During the arena and Colloseum battles, you saw the crowds cheering. They movie depicted the crowds as very dirty people. Some of them were eating food and the food would be falling out of their mouths. It seems like the movie was trying to show the crowds as barbaric monsters for cheering at these games of death. Another aspect was that the Roman&#8217;s were a militaristic society. Warfare and death were important elements of their society. In the opening scene, a massive battle occurs between the Roman army and the Germanic Barbarians. Before the battle begins, Crowe says to a fellow commanding officer, &#8220;strength and honor.&#8221; Before Crowe&#8217;s first battle in the Colosseum, a fellow gladiator gave a speech about how to address the emperor and ended the speech by saying, &#8220;Go and die with honor!&#8221; Today, people just live their lives knowing that death is inevitable and most fear it. It is very interesting to know that a culture actually embraced death and wanted to make sure that when they passed on they would be remembered.</p>
<p>Overall, Gladiator is a great movie. It has just the right amount of action and violence to keep people interested and a great story. The idea of a man going from being one of the most powerful men in Rome to being a slave makes a great movie.</p>

					<p>Through out high school I have been taught that the second world war was great for our economy. Then I get to college and my &#8220;Adam Smith view, Liberal,&#8221; says that the war was not good for our economy, here are the reasons why, someone please help me understand, now I&#8217;m torn between my thoughts of the war on the economy. In high school I was taught that the war was good because there was a decline in the unemployment rates. However, my professor told us that the times during the war were not standard times, and that 18% of the jobs created were by the drafting of military members. Also he said that you cannot count women working during the war because they would not have chose to do so. Over all he said that this claim is false because the employment created was not promoting well being of the people so it doesn&#8217;t count.</p>
<p>In high school I was also taught that there was a great increase in the measure of real gnp, but he disarms this idea with saying that the production of war materials such as tanks and guns do should not count in the GNP, only &#8216;butter,&#8217; the things that would be produced in normal peace times. So here are some things that my professor has tried to discredit, Im lost for what the right answer is, maybe its a matter of perception.</p>

				<h2><a href="/courses/history120/spring07/monty-python-and-the-holy-grail.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Monty Python and the Holy Grail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a></h2>
				<small>March 7th, 2007 <!-- by nkaltenbach --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>There are only a few select movies that can withstand the test of time. When you think of movies that fit this category you might come up with “Star Wars”, “Titanic”, “Gladiator”, other movies similar to these. Very few movies can incorporate history, and comedy, and in my opinion survive this test better then “Monty Python and the Holy Grail”. <strong>Although it does it in a silly and humorous manner, “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” manages to incorporate many elements, legends, and styles of living in medieval England.</strong></p>
<p>First it is important to understand that this movie is not meant to be taken seriously at all, therefore while it depicts aspects of medieval England, but does it in a way to get you to laugh. With that in mind, let’s look at one of the most famous scenes from the movie. Anyone who has ever scene this movie can, and most likely will, start rambling off quotes from the scene where King Arthur and his knights come to the French castle. This scene of course is completely ridiculous, and nothing like this probably ever happened, however it does call into play something that was happening for many hundreds of years, and that is the fact that around this time period the English and the French did not get along at all, which stretched up through the time of the American Revolution. Another aspect of the time period that is portrayed, again in a way to make you laugh, is the black plague. While the scene from the movie takes this all very lightly, the black plague was one of the most devastating epidemics in human history. Another very important part of medieval England is their strong religious ties. The entire movie is centered around God telling King Arthur and his knights to go on a quest to find the “holy grail”. The scene in the movie where god comes and talks to King Arthur and his knights is priceless. God appears to talk to them, and then proceeds to yell at them for graveling at first, then for apologizing to him, and then for averting their eyes from him.</p>
<p>The movie also covers many of the legends from medieval England. The biggest one is the actual legend of King Arthur. It is highly speculated that King Arthur was entirely made up, and its sole purpose is to portray the way a king should rule during both war, and peace. It is said that Arthur’s table of knights was round so that everyone who sits at it is equal since there is no head of the table. Of the knights that sat at this table, Sir Bedivere, Sir Galahad, and Sir Lancelot, are all in the movie with King Arthur. Knights mentioned in the movie that I could find no proof of being at the round table however were Sir Robin, and Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film. Another big legend is the legend of the “holy grail”. According to the legend the “holy grail” is the dish, plate or cup used by Jesus at the last supper, and is said to possess miraculous powers. There is also a reference to a classical legend in this movie. Most people are familiar with the Trojan Horse legend from ancient Greece. Well in this movie Arthur and his knights attempt their own take on this classic myth to gain entrance to the French castle, only instead of using a horse they use a rabbit. Of course this is all outrageously false, but is mainly used to create just another comical element to the movie.</p>
<p>Life in England at this time is also shown in this movie, but in such a way as to come off as comical. For example, as King Arthur rides through the town in the opening scene of the movie one peasant asks another who he, referring to Arthur, is. The other peasant responds he must be a king, and when asked to explain how he knew this he responds “well he isn’t covered in shit”. This isn’t entirely accurate, although medieval England was not a good place to live if you were a peasant. Another one of the most famous scenes from this movie shows you another, less common aspect of life at this time. The famous black knight was something that one might encounter in England during these times. A black knight was simply a knight that had no liege, or a knight that was too poor to afford armor, and therefore painted their armor black in order to prevent it from rusting. A major historical inaccuracy in this movie is the witch scene, in which a peasant woman is being accused of being a witch. She is then put on a semi trial in which she is weighed against a duck to find out if she would float on water. In the end she winds up weighing the same as the duck and is therefore concluded to be a witch. However during these times there were no witch hunts, and in fact there were laws passed against believing in witchcraft at all.</p>
<p>All in all “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” might not be one of the most historically accurate movies of all time, it certainly offers a comical look into medieval England. At the rate it is going “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” might very well wind up being one of the movies that withstands the test of time, and continues to entertain generations to come.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>There have been a lot of movies produced that reenact the Vietnam War, these include “Platoon”, “Apocalypse Now”, “Forrest Gump”, and “Full Metal Jacket”.  Stanley Kubrick has created several films during his lifetime.  <strong>“Full Metal Jacket” is a film that is told through the eyes of one young Marine that experienced the Vietnam War first hand.</strong>  This film starts off in recruit training, or boot camp, during the Vietnam War era.  The entire film is told in the point of view of one man who enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and goes on to fight in the Vietnam War during the Tet Offensive as a combat photographer.  The events that unfolded during the film were accurate according to history. </p>
<p>“Full Metal Jacket” is narrated, at times, by the main character, Sgt. Davis, also known as Joker.  The very first scene in the movie is when the recruits arrive at Parris Island and are having their hair shaven off while a song plays in the background.  The song that Kubrick chose had a refrain that said, “Goodbye my sweetheart, hello Vietnam.”  This choice of song makes sense since the recruits have enlisted during time of war and they know that they will be overseas to Vietnam in a short amount of time.   The majority of the recruits will go on to become part of the infantry, better known as “grunts”.  However, Joker ends up becoming a combat photographer.  He goes to Vietnam and ends up joining a squad that has a member of his platoon from boot camp in it and takes pictures of them in action.  The rest of the film is of Joker and his photographer partner, Rapture Man, following and fighting along side with 1<sup>st</sup> platoon Hotel 2-5.</p>
<p>The intended audience for this film is anyone who wants to know about the Vietnam War and how the people fighting it felt during their time of “smoking and joking” and fighting.  Stanley Kubrick is known for making off the wall films, such as “A Clockwork Orange”, “2001:  A Space Odyssey”, “The Shining”, and his last film, “Eyes Wide Shut”.  This film is no exception.  From the “This is my rifle, this is my gun” chant in boot camp to the classic “Me so horny” and,” Me love you long time” quotes from the Vietnamese prostitute who offers her services to the hard fighting Marines.  Most of Kubrick’s films are timeless classics that have an endless amount of quotes that we still use today.  The way that he uses music and the settings in his films on not just for show, they all have a purpose.  One example of this is when the Marines are fighting in Hue City.  This battle is best known for being fought for every street and every block.  This fighting was long, tiring, and brutal.  The background, like the destroyed buildings and the shattered ruins of the streets where the Marines waited for the word, was all dark and grey.  He used this to symbolize how the Marines were fighting.  When they were being interviewed by the media, you can tell that they were tired of fighting and not getting anywhere, that they just wanted to get it over with and kill whatever wasn’t American.  “Anyone who is running is a VC, anyone who stands still is a well disciplined VC,” this is a quote that a machine gunner says to Joker when they are flying over a rice patty field and the machine gunner is going gunning women.  This also shows that you could not tell who was a VC and who was not. Kubrick shows this in one of the final scenes of the film.  A Marine, 8 Ball, has to go out and find a way through the ruins as 1<sup>st</sup> platoon is patrolling through Hue City.  He gets shot by a sniper, but it was not a kill shot.  The sniper only shot 8-Ball in the leg so that more members of the platoon would try to help 8-Ball and would get shot by the sniper as well.  This tactic works when another Marine, Doc J, tries to rescue 8-Ball and ends up being shot.  This forces the rest to try to kill the sniper.  Another Marine, the squad leader Cowboy, gets shot in the chest while he is standing next to a hole in a wall trying to make contact with his superiors.  When they finally get into the building, they come across the sniper.  The sniper was a woman.  It was very difficult to decipher VC from civilian since they did not use a uniform.  Men, women, and children were all members of the Vietcong.</p>
<p>Some songs that Kubrick used in this film include “These Boots were made for Walking” when you first see a prostitute in the film; “Paint it Black” as the end credits; the Mickey Mouse song in the final scene after killing the sniper and they are walking through a field and everything around in on fire; and the countless cadence they are chanted during p.t. runs in boot camp.  I went to boot camp in the summer of 2004 in Parris Island, where the first part of the film was shot.  A few things have changed since the release of “Full Metal Jacket”.</p>
<p>The accuracy of this film is up to par, although a few things have changed since.  The rifles featured in the film are the M14 in the boot camp scenes and the M16A1 in the Vietnam War scenes.  Both of these rifles were used in the Vietnam War era.  Today, the Marine Corps is using the M16A4 and M16M4 variants of the M16 rifle.  These new rifles are more accurate, lighter, and more adaptable than the previous versions.  The boot camp scenes were very accurate in the film.  I found myself singing along with the cadence of Senior Drill Instructor Gunnery Sgt. Hartman as they are running down the street in Parris Island.  The lingo that GySgt Hartman used throughout the film is exactly what a drill instructor would say in the boot camp of today.  “Here you are all equally worthless” is what he said when he explained that race and religion have nothing to do with how they will be treated.  GySgt Hartman also talked about Charles Whitman and Lee Harvey Oswald what “one motivated Marine and his rifle can do.”  Gomer Pile killing himself the day before they graduated is a reality.  I would here stories about how recruit could not take it anymore and they would try to escape and hang themselves with belts, shoelaces, or slings.</p>
<p>This is a great film about the Vietnam War.  The story of one Marine as he joins the Marine Corps and fight for his country is one that has been told in several movies.  There aren’t that many films or video games about the Marine Corps, mostly of the other branches, but Stanley Kubrick’s “Full Metal Jacket” is a classic.  The film is very accurate and the way that Kubrick uses music and the setting all have a purpose.  Everyone would enjoy watching this movie, unless you do not like war movies or a movie without a happy ending.</p>

				<small>March 7th, 2007 <!-- by Colin K. --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Some movies like to stay within the realm of historical fact, possibly bending the truth to simplify a story, but not this film. <strong>The “history” provided in <u>The Last Samurai</u> was heavily altered or made up to provide the average American insight into a culture that is rarely seen outside of it&#8217;s own country</strong>. This film never happened in real life.</p>
<p>Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a soldier tortured by his past of slaughtering Native Americans. He is deemed a “hero” as he was in the Battle of Gettysburg and was under the command of General Custer. He is hired to train soldiers in Japan, a country trying to become westernized. His regiment is not ready when they are ordered into battle, illustrated in a scene that bares resemblance to a scene in <u>Glory</u>. (A scene in which Matthew Broderick&#8217;s character simulates a stressful battle condition to prove the the African troops had not been trained well enogh) Here, Algren walks in front of a solder and orders him to kill him or the soldier would be shot, the nameless man takes his shot, missing Algren, proving that they are not ready. They are sent to battle anyway, the unit getting horribly defeated and Algren is captured by the samurai revolutionaries that cling to the old ways of the bow and blade. Living among them, he learns their language, and embraces their way of life eventually leading the final charge against the imperialist Japanese troops along side Katsumoto, the leader of the revolt.</p>
<p>Nathan Algren never existed. Katsumoto never existed, and the United States had little to no deals with the Japanese in their arms build-up since the US was still in the Reconstruction period after the Civil War. Japan dealt mostly with the British, French and Dutch in weapons deals and training almost 10 years before this movie take place. By 1877, (the year this takes place) Japan already had a strong imperialistic army and navy. The events described in this movie relate to the Satsuma Rebellion, specifically the Battle of Shiroyama, the only full scale battle shown in the movie. Katsumoto’s real life counterpart is Saigō Takamori. Takamori led his rebellion in a western uniform and was aided by modern technology, but was still out-numbered nearly 10 to 1. He did not solely rely on the old ways as depicted in this movie. [1]</p>
<p>The switch from European characters to American ones is obvious; America wants to watch a movie about Americans, or anything violent. If the movie was about the French, not many people would want to watch it, because Americans can not relate as well with the French, and the movie would be filled with outragous accents. So by American standards, swords plus a big American star equals a fairly successful movie.</p>
<p>The actual point of the movie is not the violence or the &#8220;historical content,&#8221; it was about Bushido, the honor code of the samurai. Characters go as far as to say that we, Americans, are really the barbarians because we have no honor or sense. To get the most out of the concept of bushido, the movie is given in the point of view of the rogue samurai as opposed to the Japanese war machine. By tricking American audiences into seeing a violent movie, they were cultured in some Japanese beliefs. With the heavy focus on Japanese culture, the profits from Japan were higher than those in the US [2] because they didn&#8217;t need to be tricked into seeing this movie.</p>
<p>Despite being a moderately good movie in my opinion, it is not the most accurate movie to watch to find out historical events. But if every movie followed historical accounts to the letter, we would only get clones of <u>Gods and Generals</u>.</p>

				<small>March 7th, 2007 <!-- by maiko2387 --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The movie Titanic is an epic portrayal of the tragic sinking of an “unsinkable” ship.  The  main story begins with Rose, an upper class passenger, boarding the ship.  She is accompanied by her mother and her very wealthy fiancé.  During her first night on the ship, she becomes overly aware that she is very unhappy with her life, and contemplates jumping off the boat.  It is that moment when she meets Jack, a third class passenger, who saves her from falling into the icy waters.  From that point on, the two instantly have a bond and soon fall in love.  This leads to problems for Rose because her mother does not approve.  Her fiancé obviously is also enraged about the situation.  Rose has to choose between true love, and a life of wealth and prestige. In the end, Rose picks Jack and the two brave the sinking of the ship together.  Unfortunately, Jack does not survive. However, Rose never regrets her choice.</p>
<p><strong>The overall purpose of this movie is to show that love and happiness are more important than money and status.</strong> The main character is forced to make the decision between the two, and she chooses love. The directors were able to use history to further their purpose by setting the movie in 1912, when the Titanic actually sailed.  During the early 1900’s, wealth determined not only how much income you had, but who your friends could be, the clubs and restaurants in which you were allowed in, the jobs for which you were eligible, and in the case of the Titanic, the part of the ship upon which you were allowed to reside.  The fact that wealth held so much power in that time makes Rose’s choice more poignant.  She was not just giving up money, but also all the status and privileges that came along with it.  In this day and age, social classes, while still present, are not so rigidly defined.  If the movie was set in the present, her choice would not have been as meaningful.  The directors did a good job of showing how separated the two classes of people were.  Besides the huge differences in accommodations of the two classes, the directors made a strong point of showing that Jack needed special permission to even enter the first class dinning hall.  Cruise ships these days have one dinning hall, and all passengers are allowed to enter, regardless of the type of room or ticket they have.</p>
<p>The directors also furthered their purpose by using Rose as the narrator of the movie.  The point of view was from an upper class passenger, but one whom was unhappy with her status.  The audience is given a first hand glimpse of what life was like for the upper class.  There are scenes which show wealthy men spending their entire nights smoking cigars and boasting about how wonderful they are, and a scene which shows a mother fretting about whether or not her daughter is folding her napkin properly.  The directors were able to use Rose’s perception of the people around her to convey how trite and almost silly life was for the upper class.  In the end of the movie, when you see these exercises in etiquette contrasted with the real and horrific scenes of the sinking, you cannot help but agree with Rose’s choice.  When one is facing death, status and material possessions no longer matter.  The movie would not have been as compelling if told from Jack’s point of view.  Being a third class passenger, he was surrounded by people who already knew and appreciated the value of love over material possessions.  The audience would not have been able to watch them learn the hard lesson we see the upper class passengers learning.</p>
<p>This movie is aimed at a very broad audience.  There are story lines involving characters of all ages and social classes.  The fact that the main character is shown both while she is a young woman on the ship, and as an older woman recounting her tale, reinforces the universal appeal.  The younger women can identify with the younger Rose and vice a versa.  Likewise, most young men can identify with Jack and his friends, and older men can identify with various scenes of older gentlemen on the ship.</p>
<p>The cinematography adds to the power of the movie because the scenes are both vivid and realistic.  The directors chose to show all the horrendous details of the sinking.  The audience sees people both falling and voluntarily jumping off the boat.  Some of these individuals hit the water hard, while others crash into metal bars or propellers. There are people are fighting to get on life boats, and guards shooting at them like dogs.  Children are lost and screaming for their parents.   Various ship members commit suicide, some out of fear, and some out of guilt.  This climax is followed by the erie sight of thousands of bodies frozen in the water.  These scenes truly capture the tragedy of what happened that night.  The death is palpable, and the worst part is that everyone watching knows it all could have been prevented.  The audience is told in the beginning of the movie that the number of life boats were decreased for upper class aesthetic purposes.  This ultimately shows how people can get so caught up with their money and material things, they forget the priceless value of just being alive.</p>
<p>Lastly, as far as the historical accuracy of the movie, the directors were on point.  The design and structure of the ship were very accurate.  The physics of how the ship hit the ice berg and sank were also correct.  Some of the characters, like “The Unsinkable Molly Brown,” and John Jacob Astor were real people on the ship, and the other characters were fair representations of the other passengers.  It is true that there were only about half the required number of life boats, and that they were being sent out only half full.  It is true that Captain was given ice berg warnings which he chose to ignore, and it is true that he felt so guilty that he did choose to go down with his ship.  The only part of the movie which seemed to be somewhat inaccurate was the love story between Jack and Rose.  In reality, the chances of a first class lady even talking to a third class guy are very slim.  The chances of them interacting enough to fall in love and are even slimmer.  The two classes were really kept very separate and it was inappropriate for them to mingle.  It is not to say it would be impossible for these two characters to meet and fall in love, but it is highly unlikely.  The love story definitely served the directors dramatic and thematic purpose, but this type of romance probably did not actually happen on the Titanic.</p>
<p>Regardless of the real world plausibility of the romance between Rose and Jack, the story line made for a powerful movie.  The directors took an infamous piece of history and molded it into an important lesson for future generations.  Money and power are fleeting, but the joy of just living and loving are what will last forever.</p>

				<p>Through out high school I have been taught that the second world war was great for our economy. Then I get to college and my &#8220;Adam Smith view, Liberal,&#8221; says that the war was not good for our economy, here are the reasons why, someone please help me understand, now I&#8217;m torn between my thoughts of the war on the economy. In high school I was taught that the war was good because there was a decline in the unemployment rates. However, my professor told us that the times during the war were not standard times, and that 18% of the jobs created were by the drafting of military members. Also he said that you cannot count women working during the war because they would not have chose to do so. Over all he said that this claim is false because the employment created was not promoting well being of the people so it doesn&#8217;t count.</p>
<p>In high school I was also taught that there was a great increase in the measure of real gnp, but he disarms this idea with saying that the production of war materials such as tanks and guns do should not count in the GNP, only &#8216;butter,&#8217; the things that would be produced in normal peace times. So here are some things that my professor has tried to discredit, Im lost for what the right answer is, maybe its a matter of perception.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m not quite sure where your professor is coming from, or what she/he is arguing specifically. There are lots of different things goign on in your post. I would certainly argue that the war helped the economy far more than it hurt it. It created jobs, increased government spending, and generated more revenue than ever before. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not really sure what you mean when you say &#8220;not standard times.&#8221; World War Two was not really &#8220;typical,&#8221; but neither was the Great Depression.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not an economist, or even an economic historian. I agree that the production of tanks and guns does not count toward GNP, but the production of tanks and guns gave more folks jobs, who could then go out and buy butter or other stuff that does contribute to the GNP.</p>
<p>Then, you would have to look at the long term effects of the war, 10-15 years afterward. It may not have had an immediate effect, but I would argue that it did have a long-term effect in stimulating growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over all he said that this claim is false because the employment created was not promoting well being of the people so it doesnâ€™t count.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, I would argue that this is very relative&#8230;how would you define &#8220;well being of the people?&#8221;</p>

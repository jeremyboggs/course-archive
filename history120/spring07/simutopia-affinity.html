				<p>We hold these truths…<br />
We hold that a moral revival in these United States is possible without Puritanism; that is, without busybodies meddling into our personal affairs, without thought police controlling our intellectual life. We can attain a recommitment to moral values – without puritanical excesses…<br />
We hold that law and order can be restored without turning this country of the free into a police state, as long as we grant public authorities some carefully crafted and circumscribed new powers…<br />
We hold that the family – without which no society has ever survived, let alone flourished – can be saved, without forcing women to stay at home or otherwise violating their rights…<br />
We hold that schools can provide essential moral education – without indoctrinating young people…<br />
We hold that people can live in communities without turning to vigilantes or becoming hostile to one another…<br />
We hold that the pursuit of self-interest can be balanced by a commitment to the community, without requiring us to lead a life of austerity, altruism, or self-sacrifice….<br />
We hold that political officials can be civil and productive, while having different opinions, and still pursue the best interest of the entire community…<br />
We hold that powerful special-interest groups in the nation’s capital, and in so many statehouses and city halls, can be curbed without limiting the constitutional right of the people to lobby and petition those who govern….<br />
We hold these truths as affinitians, as people committed to creating a new moral, social, and public order based on restored communities, without Puritanism or oppression.<br />
The Jacksonian Era was a very influential time in the history of the United States. Expanded suffrage, manifest destiny, and patronage are just a few of the key changes in the nation. However, the political landscape continued to follow the same path of partisanship. <strong>Party politics and sectionalism were the predominant problems of the era.</strong> My utopian society, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67904202@N00/396864140/">Affinity</a>, is structured to correct the problems associated with the individualistic nature of the previous era.<br />
Since the formation of the Unites States, the resistance between political groups can be identified in each era. Jacksonian democracy was resisted by the Whig party. A major problem during Andrew Jackson’s presidency was the Nullification Crisis. It arose because of sectional differences concerning the Tariff of 1828. “Every state had numerous political factions, but they did not cross state lines.” The United States has consistently faced problems, because different factions try to pursue their own agenda, in the name of nation at large. If every citizen had more of a community-oriented mindset, it would eliminate many of the conflicts associated with individualism.<br />
The edict written above is the cornerstone of my utopian society, Affinity. A nation grounded in these principles has an opportunity to achieve a better sense of unity and community values. Given that the constitution of the Unites States was written in 1787, dilemmas arise because it is relevant for modern times. In Affinity, the edict is shaped for the present era, but is updated by new generations to represent the entire community’s values. Since the members of Affinity share the same core beliefs, this task will not be difficult. Despite being community oriented, individualism is highly encouraged. Having community values while promoting individualism seems like a paradox, however if citizens have their own ambitions and desires while adhering to what is best for the community, it is possible. Having an entire community believe the same core values may seem impractical, but it is how most nations are. The United States does not demand that all the citizens believe in the same basic values, but still most citizens share the same common beliefs: the Bill of Rights lays out most of the beliefs. Affinity will endeavor to do the same.<br />
Geographically, Affinity is designed around a square with Public Buildings in the middle, and Housing and Farming on the outside. Each member of the community has separate plots of land, equally spaced apart. There is farming land, for people to grow crops, and there are factories for other people to work at. The community is primarily capitalist based, but individuals are allowed, based on the edict of the community, to follow more traditional subsistence based living methods. Every citizen has the possibility of achieving their wishes, as long as they believe in the edict of the community. Politicians are very similar to modern times and the Jacksonian Era, although there are no political parties. They can have different ideas on how to serve the community, but instead of pursuing their own agenda, they work together to better serve the community. Affinity is a community shaped very similar to the United States today. The difference is there are clearly defined values and morals that the citizens believe and accept, as condition to live there. By doing what is best for the community, everybody is able to live in a realistic utopia.<br />

			<p>I enjoyed your edict at the beginning and your town name. It seemed almost authentic. You seemed to have set some resonable goals.Unfortunately, I must point out something I found&#8230; funny in one of the notes in your picture. </p>
<p>&#8220;Parks give the children the ability to play without being near the parks or public buildings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parks to play in without being near the parks? What a magical place!</p>

			<p>The idea of eliminating political parties is a good idea if it can be pulled off.  Political party alignment has been a problem for as long as political parties have existed becasue people are more likely to vote along party lines than on the actual issues.  I agree with the idea of a caplitalist based economy while still allowing other options to citizens that are not able to prosper in a capitalist economy.</p>

			<p>I like this Utopia. Probably because it is very similar to life today and I like they way we live our life. You seem to have a lot of good ideas on what needs to be done to be a successful society. Letting everyone be individuals and have their own opinion is good and allowing them to do things that they want to do. I really like that idea because you aren&#8217;t trying to control the people that live in your Utopia, like some places today.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t see that many problems with the Utopia. I like the ideas because your Utopia is a lot like me that it is based around the United States today. So it is hard for me to find  fault in something that I believe too, but I&#8217;m going to try here. The thing that I might pick about is that having people say their opinions and doing what is best for the community, might not always be best for everyone in the community and by having people be so individuals will have to cause some kind of disagreements among the citizens. That might not make sense, but it sounded better in my head.</p>

			<p>In a way, you simutopia is sort of like mine. We both recognized the importance of having individualism. Though that is sort of where we branch out in different directions. You focused on trying to strengthen the community as a whole, while still achieving independence. My whole simutopia revolves around individualism and being able to keep work and private lives separate. As well, your structure is a little different then mine. You placed the public buildings and factories in the middle of the town. I placed the factories on the opposite end of the houses and farms. </p>
<p>Your blog post was super creative and I really enjoyed reading it. You really went in depth and talked about everything that people needed to know. I liked how you talked about the history and what influenced you to make your simutopia the way that you ultimately did. The one thing that I would say I wish you would have talked a little more about the geographical location of everything and why you placed roads and certain other aspects where you did. Don’t get me wrong, it took a lot out of me to find something wrong with it!!</p>

			<p>The edict at the beginning is awesome, it seems like it is out of Aldus Huxley’s “A Brave New World”.  The essay is very well written and offers a few very good ideas.  The problem I see with this society is that they are trying to have their cake and eat it to.  In my opinion man can either be conditioned to be a selfish being or a community oriented being, but never both at the same time.  Also in the last paragraph you state that “every citizen has the possibility of achieving their wishes, as long as they believe in the edict of the community”, this statement makes the idea of individualism impossible.  It is impossible because individualism at its very core is believing what you want and in a society that forces a set of beliefs on it citizens, no matter how few, true individualism can never be achieved.</p>

			<p>You have a lot of ideas about how to live life by read your blog. Because your utopia more like the life we live today, and also you recognized the importance of having individualism. Everyone live life the way they want to, also there isn’t government in your simutopia. After saw your simutopia picture, I really amazing about how you built your simutopia, I think it’s the best simutopia I ever see. However, if you can talk more about your simutopia, and why you built that way. Over all this is very good blog, and I really enjoyed read it.</p>

			<p>Your edict at the beginning was excellent.  It really got me interested about what you were going to say later on in your paper.  It was a good way to start off your essay.  I liked how your letting everyone be individuals and have their own opinions.  It is like life today.  This will make everyone happy because they can speak out and do what they want without worrying about getting in trouble.  On the other hand though, you better watch out for this because eventually it can get out of hand and people might start abusing your system.  I don&#8217;t really have any other critques besides that one.  This essay was well written from beginning to end and had a numerous amount of good ideas.  Good Job!</p>

			<p>I really like how you started it off with your town&#8217;s own preamble; that made it seem very realistic. I think  you had a lot of good ideas for your town and if they were to work, it would be wonderful. I dont think a town would work well if everything equal. There always has to be someone with more land or money. I also dont think it would ever work to have no political parties. I feel that it would someday down the road lead to chaos and maybe one person trying to take power.</p>

			<p>Your community seems like everyone will not be afraid to voice their thoughts because you encourage them to show their individuality.  I agree everyone should be looked as an individual so that no one will make assumptions by the way certain people dress or their appearance.  Practicing individualism will help people to become independent and accepting of others&#8217; views as well.  This is a great way for people see difference as a great thing.  Being different will seem normal in your society.  I also thought it was unique how you made your community.  It is great that you included everything (i.e. farming, housing, park, etc).</p>
<p>I think your blog would have been better if you expanded on the rules of your utopian community.  The statements you make seem a bit broad.  It would have been good if you elaborated on religion or specific laws people have to follow in order to maintain a stable community.  I was still a bit confused after reading your blog because I felt there was more information you could elaborate on.  For example, who would the people need to come into terms with if there are disagreements?  Is there a particular social status or hierarchy?  How can these people work together to better serve their community?  Overall your post was interesting to read and I liked the quotes you added in the beginning.</p>

			<p>Wow. I just really like this blog. You did a great job describing what is important to your community and I love how it encourages so much individuality, while still making family important. I also really liked that you including everything you could into your community. When I made my utopia I also did this because I also believe that it is important for areas to not have to rely too heavily on others for things they need. My favorite line by far was &#8220;We hold that political officials can be civil and productive, while having different opinions, and still pursue the best interest of the entire community.&#8221; Politicans of our nation could take some pointers from this statement.</p>
<p>I agree with some of the others that you could have expanded on the actual rules and laws of Affinity. Just saying the community values are important and everyone in the community thinks that as well, doesn&#8217;t really set up a system for what to do if something does go wrong. However, this was very interesting to read and gave a lot of good details about your community. I really enjoyed this.</p>

			<p>I enjoyed reading your edict, it seemed legit. I feel like you are veering in the right direction with your idea of individualism within the community, without the opportunity to be an individual I believe it is only a matter of time before human nature takes over and the people revolt, I believe it is within every person to fight for freedom, or the right to be an individual. At the same time you recognize the need for community relations, which is vital for any place to thrive. If you were to build on your edict and go more in depth I could see it as a working &#8220;constitution&#8221; type of document, obviously it is lacking in detail but for the purpose of the assignment I feel as though it gave enough info.</p>

			<p>Very original how you added your edict in the beginning.  You basically had a shopping list of what you want your utopia to be.  All of your ideas are great and sounds like it would be a wonderful society to be a part of.  The chances of your utopia being created, let alone ever exist, is very slim.  I like how you said that your utopia is a lot like the United States, since we seem to be a very well structured nation.  I guess the only problem that I have with your post is that you repeated &#8220;We hold&#8221; for every single line in you edict.  I guess it makes it seem more dramatic, but you should be able to change it up and still keep you flow.</p>

			<p>I thought it was cool how you started out, as if the town had its own constitution or something. It clearly outlined what the inhabitants believed and how they lived. But, I don&#8217;t particularly like how the town is mapped out. It seemed unnatural to me to have the houses bordering the town. I could see just one street with houses on either side, but not surrounding the town. Why are there only two roads, and why don&#8217;t they run through the town? Other than that, though, I really like the ideas that you have.</p>

			<p>Your utopia is similar to the life we live today and you also noted the importance of having individualism. They way you built your utopia is interesting because the way you designed it looks cool. And the way you started you post was really unique and attention grabbing. The well organized structure you gave to your utopia fits well in today&#8217;s society. Nice post.</p>

			<p>I can tell you spent a lot of time thinking of the details of your post. Most of the aspects of your community are similar to mine. That is, individualism is important as well as community values. It is critical that having morals is of utmost importance in your utopia, and that the politicians do not have their own agendas other than to make the community a better place. Also, it was nice that you included some background history, which gives some explanation of the reasons why you made your utopia the way you did. It was very original of you to write the specific ground rules of your utopia, rather than simply explaining them vaguely within the body of your post. The only thing is that I didn’t see a system for how to deal with problems, and I also think the layout of the town is not that smart.</p>

			<p>I have to say your post was very impressive. It is very much how we live our lives today. My utopia is very similar to yours. You recognize the importance of individualism and that is my key thing in my utopia. I love how you included everything in your utopia, I did as well.<br />
You took a very different approach writing your post which I liked alot. Your beginning was very creative and it was definitely an attention grabber. It seems like you put alot of thought into it. The only thing I would suggest would be to eloborate on some of your rules. Otherwise, I love your utopia. Good post.</p>

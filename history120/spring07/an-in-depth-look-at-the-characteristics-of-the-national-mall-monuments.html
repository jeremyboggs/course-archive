				<p>The monuments in Washington D.C. give us an opportunity to respect and<br />
honor our past heroes and leaders.  Each memorial has distinct and<br />
significant characteristics reflecting how we remember the person or people<br />
the monument memorializes.  They also have a few similar traits as well. The<br />
size of each masterpiece is a notable congruence between many of those in<br />
D.C. as well as their positioning around the nation¹s capital.  <strong>The<br />
monuments on the national mall conjure up images of power, significance and achievement through their size, placement and detail.<br />
</strong><br />
George Washington is the most celebrated and storied president in United<br />
States history.  So significant is the country’s first president that many<br />
universities, streets and counties have been named after him not to mention<br />
a state and the US capital.  After so many dedications one may see yet<br />
another one to be excessive and meaningless and so the Washington monument<br />
had to be something spectacular, and it is!  Like the man himself, the<br />
monument dominates the surrounding space.  Washington himself was extremely<br />
tall for the time period, measuring over six feet and this is represented<br />
splendidly in the size of the monument.  It is only fitting that no building<br />
in DC can be built taller than the Washington monument.  If something were<br />
built bigger, it would detract from how we remember the man and go a long<br />
way to denigrate the monument’s significance. Washington is also remembered<br />
for the unfaltering military leadership he provided to the colonists in the<br />
face of the world’s most powerful military during the Revolutionary War.<br />
Another important facet of the memorial is its placement.  The monument<br />
dominates the surrounding skyline and no building in sight is half the size<br />
of the memorial, as a building even close to rivaling its grandeur would<br />
surely detract from the overall appearance and power it commands. Its<br />
placement is another aspect that highlights the important role Washington<br />
played in US history. His monument is at the end of the National Mall<br />
directly opposite the nation’s capital. The country’s democracy is run<br />
primarily through the Capitol building and the Washington monument is facing<br />
one of the most important structures in the world, as if to say that without<br />
George Washington, this building may not be here today. The final aspect of<br />
the monument that commands respect from its many visitors is its attention<br />
to detail. It needed exactly 36,491 marble and granite blocks to complete<br />
the monument and each of these stones had to be a specific size and weight<br />
in order to fit together perfectly.  The monument as a whole asserts a<br />
prominent and commanding image on the nation’s capital and this mirrors<br />
Washington¹s influence on his fellow colonials during his lifetime.</p>
<p>The second monument I visited was the recently completed World War II<br />
memorial.  The monument is a fitting tribute to those who gave their lives<br />
for their country and again size, placement and detail represent the<br />
ultimate sacrifice these soldiers had to make.  Initially one will notice<br />
the size of this monument.  Although it does not dominate the skyline like<br />
the Washington monument, the shape and width of the memorial represent many<br />
people rather than just one.  The placement of this memorial is quite<br />
significant as it stands in line with the Washington Monument and the<br />
Capitol building.  Not only is the placement of the monument important on an<br />
emotive level, it is also highly aesthetically pleasing to see the structure<br />
in line with the Washington Monument.  When one takes a step back and takes<br />
in the memorial in front of the Washington Monument, there is really no more<br />
powerful sight in the whole of Washington D.C.  If the Washington Monument<br />
is remarkable because of its size, the WWII monument is most certainly<br />
impressive for its detail.  The first aspect of detail one may notice is the<br />
symmetry.  The angles and shapes involved in this structure look almost too<br />
perfect to be real.  This symmetry could represent each and every member of<br />
the military during WWII equally as every man who served risked dying.  The<br />
52 columns outlining the monument represent another impressive aspect of the<br />
monument.  Each column is exactly the same height except for the two big<br />
columns at either side of the memorial that represent the Pacific and<br />
Atlantic oceans.  These columns show the individual states that supplied<br />
troops to fight in the world’s biggest war and represent how unity as<br />
opposed to division won the war.  The pool in the middle of the monument is<br />
another important detail and is the most popular part of the memorial for<br />
visitors, especially in the summer.  This pool represents eternal sacrifice<br />
of the troops as the pool is constantly full and is another way of saying<br />
that we will never forget.  The field of 4,000 gold stars is possibly the<br />
most significant part of the entire memorial.  Each star represents a<br />
thousand of the 400,000 who died during the course of the United State¹s<br />
involvement in the war.  The feeling this wall generates in the many<br />
visitors is one of deep sadness but also one of appreciation to those who<br />
served and died fighting for freedom and their country.  The WWII memorial<br />
represents the more than 400,000 Americans who died fighting for what they<br />
held sacred.  From the positioning of the monument to the extreme detail<br />
taken by the architect, this memorial helps us to remember those brave men<br />
and women who lost their lives during World War II.</p>
<p>The last monument I visited was the Lincoln memorial.  This memorial was<br />
completely different to the first two I had visited and as it exhibited a<br />
human form in the shape of a seated Abraham Lincoln.  This monument’s size<br />
is its distinguishing feature much like the Washington Monument.  The size<br />
represents the significance and importance of Lincoln in American history<br />
and his role in the Civil War to keep the country united and to free the<br />
slave.  Lincoln was also a great orator and two of his famous speeches are<br />
inscribed on the inside of the “temple”.  The Gettysburg Address and<br />
Lincoln’s second inaugural address represent two of the greatest speeches in<br />
the history of the United States and the sheer size of the inscriptions on<br />
the inside of the memorial highlight the effect those words had on the<br />
course of events during and after the Civil War.  Again placement is a major<br />
aspect of the memorial and is part of the reason I chose to visit this<br />
particular memorial.  The positioning of this memorial in line with the<br />
Capitol, the Washington Monument and the WWII memorial represent just how<br />
significant Lincoln’s presidency was and is.  It seems that memorials and<br />
monuments on the National Mall are to those who had the greatest influence<br />
on this relatively young country’s history and it is a great testament of<br />
Abraham Lincoln’s presidency and life that his memorial would be put on the<br />
same level as these monuments. Finally, detail on this monument was a key in<br />
adequately memorializing this great American president. Everything about the<br />
statue of Lincoln is accurate from facial characteristics to the scale of<br />
his frame.  The 36 columns at the entrance represent the 36 Union at the<br />
time of Lincoln’s death and this is highly significant as there may not have<br />
been a Union at that time had Lincoln not been president.  The placement of<br />
this monument signifies Abraham Lincoln’s importance and place in American<br />
history.  Details such as the two inscriptions on the inside of the monument<br />
as well as the 36 columns at the entrance to the memorial show visitors just<br />
how important Abraham Lincoln was to the United States.</p>
<p>The three monuments I visited all had a similar location and significance in<br />
American history.  Lincoln and Washington were two of the nations most<br />
important and influential president’s while World War II<br />
represented one of the costliest wars America has ever participated in.  I<br />
chose these four monuments because I felt that each one remembered either<br />
great achievement or remembered great sacrifice. Each memorial evoked<br />
entirely different emotions and the size, placement and detail of each<br />
monument effected how I perceived and thought about each one.<br />

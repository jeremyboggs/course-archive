				<p>Monuments never struck me as being interesting, or a must see, but I was very surprised at how each of the monuments made me feel. Each had a different feeling attached but they all overwhelmingly made me feel humbled. The monuments made me have a different respect for history and for the great city, Washington D.C., which is only a few miles from our home. The immense humbling feeling I received made me wonder how a building could do that to me. How does the design of the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, and the World War II Memorial make you feel so incredibly humbled and small.</p>
<p>The Washington Monument can be seen from just about anywhere in Washington D.C. If your high enough up. The monument greets you when you are entering Washington D.C. from Virginia. It reminds you of the history of the great city every time you pass it but it does not show its true potential until you see it in person. When seeing the Washington Monument and looking to the sky surrounded by American Flags, you feel a sense of meekness and empowerment at the same time. Was this what the builders had imagined the monument to do? How does the monument bring about so many emotions when it is just a building? The Washington Monument is not an elaborate building but it is high. It towers over you to make George Washington seem larger than life. I do not think it just stands for George Washington any more. The feeling I received from the monument was that it stood for not only the first president but the city as well as the country. The height and strength of the building is what makes emotions soar when visiting, unlike the World War II Memorial.</p>
<p>The World War II Memorial evokes a sense of reflection and humble thinking. It made me feel small while being there. I felt as if I have not done enough in my life compared to the people that fought and died in the war. I could not figure out why I felt that way at the memorial but not while learning about World War II. The memorial was so large in proportion that it makes you feel small and insignificant. I walked through and there was so much to look at compared to other monuments. What other monuments have in sheer size this monument has in size and remembrances. The World War II Memorial has the potential to make you spend the day looking at everything that is there. The memorial may not be tall and overpowering but it is large. The memorial also has huge fountains which drown out noise that helps you concentrate on what you are looking at. The pillars at each side look small in comparison to the memorial but the fact that twenty people can stand inside comfortably does not do the pillars much justice. The pillars are extremely large and empowering from the inside, exactly like the Lincoln Memorial.</p>
<p>The Lincoln Memorial and its grandeur is incredible. From far away it somewhat resembles the White House. I thought the statue of Abraham Lincoln was going to be life-like and that the building would not be that big on the inside, I was completely wrong. The Lincoln Memorial took me aback. It was hard to believe how strong it mad me feel standing on the stairs looking out onto the Washington Monument. The memorial made me feel differently when I walked in. I felt very small and humbled in front of the Abraham Lincoln Statue.</p>
<p>The Lincoln Memorial, World War II Memorial, and the Washington Monument humble you just by the way they are built to make you feel insecure standing next to them. The monuments make you feel as if you are not as good as the people they are made after. They make you feel as if you are small in comparison to the people the monuments were made after. The monuments evoke a lot of feelings which no text book could possibly bring about.</p>

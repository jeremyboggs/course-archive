				<p>While you may believe that with all of our high powered technology and scientific advancements, we will soon be in the age of the jetsons, that view may be completely wrong. According to Mayan Prophecies, the world is scheduled to end on December 21, 2012. Yes the Mayans were people who inhabited this planet a long long time ago back in 250 A.D., and technology then is not what it is now, but why is it that the Mayan calendar is still considered to be more accurate than the one that we use today. <strong>All of the Mayan doomsday prophecies to date have been correct and have actually occured, if we don&#8217;t start to take action now in finding a resolution, life as we know it may end.</strong></p>
<p>Although the Mayan civilizations communicated through hieroglyph drawings, they were actually a very scientifically advanced civilization. They possessed great knowledge within the realms of astrology, mathematics, timing, and calendars. They were even so precise that they had two calendars, one that was ritualistic and used for astral predictions and religious celebratrions. The other was a solar calendar. Both calendars were based upon a principle that a year had more than the 365 days, unlike the Gregorian Calendar in which we rely on to date. Through the use of these calendars Mayans were able to predict natural occurances such as Seasons and even eclipses. Something that in that day and age would seem almost impossible.</p>
<p>The Mayans figured through use of astrology and their two calendars that the earths rotation around the galaxy would take is 25,625 years to realign in the same manner. This period was then divided in to 5 cycles of 5,125 years. It was speculated that every 5,125 year cycle the earth would realign with the &#8216;central&#8217; galaxy theory, effectively changing the Sun&#8217;s magnetic fields resulting in catastrophic evens on earth. According to Mayan predictions we are currently in between the 5th and 6th cycles. More information about the prophecies and signs can be found <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/mjfinley/katun.html">here.</a></p>
<p>Overall the Mayans were way ahead of their time. The excess knowledge that they possesed is hard to comprehend without the use of modern day technology. It is debatable whether or not the world will actually end at the end of the Mayan calendar, or if we will just be transcended in to a new form of life. I guess we will just have to wait and see.</p>

<p>Reading the Runaways</p>
<p align="center">Running to freedom</p>
<p align="center">
<p>It has been 200 years since we signed the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act on March 25, 1807. Yet we still have little idea on how much the slaves suffered and what their personal lives consisted of. Some tend to forget that they were families that had grandparents and children that were either slaves or never to be seen again. Some slaves had masters that took the chance and educated their slaves just a little hoping that it would allow them to work better, and some wanted to keep their slaves illiterate so they would never survive if they ran away. <strong>There were always runaway slaves and they came in all different types, from every skin color to literacy level, yet they all had one thing in common, the pursuit for freedom. </strong></p>
<p>In the ads that were provided for us from the database <em>The Geography of Slavery</em>, I found that there were many different kinds of slaves that ran away. Some of them in groups and some alone. It was interesting for two reasons, one was because they were stating the qualities that the slave possessed and the other was that the slave had these qualities to begin with. They could read, write, play instruments, use tools that took skill and they were even well mannered and could speak proper English. That was very risky for the owner because they took the chance of loosing their slave. Someone could read the ad and could keep the slave knowing what they could do for them.</p>
<p>The ads helped me understand the history of colonial Americans slavery, it showed a side of slaves that wasn’t shown in most textbooks. The ads portrayed the slaves for who they were, not just a expected depiction of what they assumed slaves to be. From wikipedia it states that “Slaves are people who are held against their will since within capture, their purchase, or there birth, and are deprived of their individual freedom for the purpose of exploitation for their labor…”. That citation shows that slaves didn’t have a choice to become a slave, but they did have the choice to run away to a chance for freedom.</p>
<p>There were runaway slaves and they came in all different types, from skin color to literacy level, yet they all had one thing in common, the pursuit for freedom. In conclusion slaves had qualities that made them who they are. All different and unique to each person, but the common factor that they didn’t possess is freedom, and that is the same thing that puts them in the same category of runaway slaves.</p>

			<p>You talk about how the ads showed a side of slavery and slaves that we don’t see in textbooks and I agree with you. We go through years of reading about slavery and how slavery was bad, but we never learn about this. Finally, we are able to see slaves for who most of them really were, strong, talented and smart. Most of the slaves had attributes that the colonists could only dream of, and that is why they were so afraid of them running away. They knew they had to keep a hold on them. You raise another interesting point about why the slaves had these qualities to begin with. I think that that also raises a question. Did the slaves have these qualities before they were slaves, or were they taught these things? In my opinion, it was probably a little of both. I am sure some of them were already talented, while others learned these talents. </p>
<p>“That citation shows that slaves didn’t have a choice to become a slave, but they did have the choice to run away to a chance for freedom.” That was my favorite line in your paper. As I read it I thought to myself, wow that is so true. Frankly, the fate of a slave lied in the hands of the slave. He/she had the upper hand in deciding what they were willing to do. To me, your paper was great I really enjoyed reading it. The only comment I can make is that in your thesis, you talked about gender, though in your paper you didn’t really mention that.</p>

			<p>Your post has potential, but I don’t think you hit the mark with it. First your thesis isn’t broadcasted through out your paper. You talk about it then you’re done. Most of your paper doesn’t even have anything to do with your thesis statement. While I’m on the subject of your thesis, another thing is that the thesis is flawed. You end by saying, “yet they all had one thing in common, freedom”, the slave did not have freedom. What they had in common was the goal to achieve Freedom!  Every slave was striped of their freedom when they were captured or born on the plantations. Your paper has great information though. If you went back and tied your thesis to the rest of the paper I believe you have a strong piece of writing.</p>

			<p>An interesting bit of trivia you placed in your paper was that the U.S. banned the trade of slaves outside the national borders, yet was still in practice for another 60 years. I liked that.</p>
<p>Your thesis is seriously flawed. It is not something that can be argued well, it&#8217;s a given. If you worded it to emphasize your point on slaves being all different as opposed to the &#8220;stupid black man&#8221; picture that is taught in elementary school, it might have been stronger. Also, you repeated your thesis in the ending paragraph, not once, but twice in a row. It can be annoying saying the same thing two times in so many sentances. See what I mean?</p>

			<p>I liked your paper because you talked about slaves in a different way from everybody else and it has taught me that their is always more than one way to look at something.  When people think of slaves they think of a person bound to somebody and has to do whatever whenever their owner decides.  You however, have discussed who the slaves actually were and not just the depiction of them.  You mentioned how they could read, write, use tools, have good manners, and even learn how to speak English.  I&#8217;m not gunna lie, I always thought slaves were nothing.  Now I know that they had a life and they were good at what they did and I realized that they were everything and that is why their owners knew they had to hold onto them.<br />
The only critique I have is your thesis.  Its really not an arguable statement because almost everybody knows that slaves wwere all different kinds of people.  Other than that it was really well written.</p>

			<p>Your post is informative and also very interesting to me. I agree with your idea that the ads showed a new side of slavery that we did not notice before. I can understand slavery in American history better throughout looking at different salves in the ads. The ads showed the life of each slave. Before I read the ads I thought salves did just laboring. Now, I realize some slaves were kind of educated and have some skills you said in your paper.</p>
<p>Your writing is well written, but I think your thesis is not strong enough. As most of people know that all salves were different, your thesis is not argued very well. Also, although your thesis mentioned about skin color and gender, you did not give any example of this in your paper. Besides that, I really liked your writing.</p>

			<p>As soon as I read the introduction of your blog you had my attention. The introductory paragraph was wonderful. You caught my attention with the first sentence and great use of your historical reference. That was a great fact of historical knowledge that I did not know. Also, the fact that slaves had different lifestyles and different skills was something that I gathered from your blog. </p>
<p>Even though your introduction was great, in the supporting paragraphs, I felt that you made your thesis weak. I feel that the thesis was well done but you had no support. Examples of the differences of the individual slaves in the groups of slaves that had run away together, and evidence showing that they all wanted to be freed would have helped your argument. Additionally, there were no references to any advertisements and I felt this also hurt your claims in the post.</p>

			<p>I agree to this article the fact when other people think of slaves, they think of them as someone who has no education and no special talents. But the truth is some of the slaves did have a decent education and special skills. This article shows us a whole other side of slaves that no one can even imagine. These slaves are like every average person you see walking down the street but since their skin color is different, it makes them different which is not right. </p>
<p>The fact that some of the slave owners taught them how to read was very kind of them to do that. After all, they can runaway anytime and never come back to its owners. In my opinion, I think that the slave owners who did educate their slaves were kind hearted and not the typical slave owners that you see on television or read in the newspaper. Also as a slave owner, most of them had kids who probably understood where the slaves were coming from. Like stated above, the slaves were parents, children, and grandparents. For someone who has family, it is hard to be the typical strict and stubborn owner that beat its slaves.</p>

			<p>I agree with respino3 about your introduction grabbing attention. Many of the other blog posts left out an introduction and I think it really adds something to your post. Also, I think you built up well to your thesis and gave a clear direction to your blog. Also, there were some interesting facts in the blog that kept the readers attention, and you really played up the emotional aspect when you talked about how some people never saw their own families again.</p>
<p>However, I think you could work a little on your support. Perhaps site some ads or give more reasons why all slaves wanted freedom as you say. I think that can be a little contradictory, because while I&#8217;m sure no one wanted to be the property of another person, many slaves were scared of life outside of the plantation they worked on and did not have any desire to try to escape their daily rountine for something unknown.</p>

			<p>I agree that all slaves were not given a choice of whether or not they were free. Africans were brought over with the intent that they would do hard labor for the colonies, but the slaves did not agree that their fate was to labor for others. They ran away often, most as I have read were caught.<br />
Your paper was written very well, but I do not think that your thesis was argumentative. The thesis stated a fact that was not backed up as much as it could have been. When using a thesis that is a fact rather than an argumentative point, it is easy to back up the fact with many quotes and points. The quotes and the advertisments you used were very good and I enjoyed reading them.</p>

			<p>I think you are a very strong writer.  I like how you stated your thesis in the beginning and restated it in the conclusion.  It began and ended your post very strongly.  However, the body of the paper was a little dull. I feel you could have brought more information and more facts into it because it is a very interesting topic.  It is true that for most of our lives we have read and learned only about certain things dealing with slavery, but never this. Your blog was pretty good, I would have enjoyed to read more though.</p>

			<p>I liked how this post started out. It got my attention and really grabbed me into the article. I thought that was a key to the article. I thought you made a good point about how skilled the slaves were and how the owners had to be cautious because they ran a risk at losing their slaves to someone else that found them. I also like how you pointed out about how reading these ads points out stuff that we don&#8217;t read about in our textbooks. So much about slaves get lost because it seems like textbook companies try to avoid the important things about slaves that we never get to learn about and it was good for you to point this out.<br />
The article was well written and provided a lot of information. My critique of it is that I don&#8217;t know why you had your thesis twice in your post. I didn&#8217;t see the need for it to be in the conclusion of the post. To me it didn&#8217;t see fit right with what you said after that. I thought your thesis was good, just didn&#8217;t see a need for it in your conclusion too.</p>

			<p>I thought it was interesting how you stated some slaves were experienced to do certain things that were forbidden to them.  The slaves who could read, write or even speak fluently were naturally smart and intelligent.  They managed to learn by themselves without the same resources the whites had.  It makes no sense how some whites were illiterate or how their slaves had more education than them.  The slaves had knowledge even though their masters most likely wanted to keep them away from it.  Some slaves were striving for education which further proves their determination.  When I read documentaries about slaves who could write, it makes me think how much they could have been capable of doing if they weren&#8217;t slaves.  The slaves who were educated would have used it greatly to their advantage to escape so that they could communicate with people who were willing to help them.</p>
<p>Your blog could have been improved if you didn’t repeat your thesis in your conclusion.  You could have interpreted it in a different way because it sounds repetitive.  Your conclusion seems to be a bit dull.  You could have summed up your thoughts and opinions better.  However, your opening sentence was a great start because you got my attention.  Great job overall, I enjoyed reading your blog post!</p>

			<p>The point you make about the slave masters keeping their slaves illiterate is interesting and something that never crossed my mind about why slaves were illiterate. Also it was interesting to learn that some slave masters actually took the chance to educate their slaves a bit so that they could be of more help. I enjoyed how in the end you said that all slaves didn&#8217;t have freedom and how that was the one thing that put them in the same category of runaway slaves.</p>
<p>I think that in the conclusion if you had rephrased your thesis to make it sound different because it didn&#8217;t sound right knowing that I had read it earlier in the post.</p>

			<p>I agree with you 100% on your view of &#8220;The ads portrayed the slaves for who they were, not just a expected depiction of what they assumed slaves to be&#8221;. We&#8217;ve read and learned so many things about slavery in history during our life. It is taught in high school and college but nothing explains it better than those personal ads. In history books we learn about slavery in general but while reading these ads, I feel like it connects us more to the slaves personal life. Everything about how the master describes him/her in the ad can tell us alot about them. For example their weight could tell us if they were fed or not and if they have any scars that would tell us if they were mistreated and whipped by their masters etc. It takes us to almost a first persons point of view to a slave and that is the closest we will ever get to seeing one.</p>

			<p>This is very interesting topic; I am really enjoyed reading your blog. You have three articles to support your writing, and I strong agree with you about slave need freedom. They want to have their own life, and they want to do whatever they want to do. You also said there were two type slave, one just hard work slave and other are skill slave. I never thought about that, I thought all slave have to work hard, and they don’t read, write and speak English. However, you don’t have enough information to support your thesis in your writing.  If you can find more information about how slave learn read, write and speak, also give more example and links to support your idea. I think over all this is very interesting and good writing.</p>

			<p>This post is well written, research-paper wise. The opening is engaging and makes me want to read on. I agree with the point that you make in which it is un-wise for a slave owner to announce in an ad how wonderful a slave is. This lessens their chance of getting the slave back because someone else will need a hardworking slave and just keep them. I also like your point that the ads help one to see that slaves were not just slaves, they were people. In the ads we can learn how tall a slave was, what they wore, drank, owned, markings on their bodies and information like that that one will never find in a text book. </p>
<p>One small thing, do not copy and paste your thesis especially when the paper is so short. It is redundant. Instead, re-word it.</p>

			<p>This is the first time that I thought about how skilled the slaves were.  They had to learn some skills eventually since they had to work with their hands in order for them to become useful for their owners.  You basically summed it up in the second to last sentence in your opening paragraph.  Slave owners either listed the skills or not.  The previous posts either said that the skills were listed or they were not, not the option of both.  So, if the slave owners listed the skills, they faced the possibility that their slaves would be taken by a different owner.  However, if they just went with the physical description and not the skills, then it would be more difficult to locate them.<br />
The educated slaves would take their chances by escaping since they know how to communicate and work on their own.  The one aspect of your post that I did not agree with is in the last sentence of your second paragraph.  It is a possibility that another slave owner would keep the slave for themselves, but what would stop the slave from running away again.</p>

			<p>I really enjoyed your post, and its angle on how all slaves shared the common goal of freedom. I also found it unique that you took the angle that the ads for run away slaves focused more on who the slaves were as people, instead of just their physical ttributes. I do not, however, fully agree that these ads were meant to show the slaves in a more human form, as they were given to just show as many details about the slave as possible, in order to maximize the potential for the slave to be found and returned. Overall, i found your post to be well written, and well researched.</p>

			<p>The thing that stuck out at me the most was a lack of support for your thesis. You also mentioned how &#8220;They could read, write, play instruments, use tools that took skill and they were even well mannered and could speak proper English.&#8221; I only saw one of your ads that mentioned a slave that could play an instrument. So, I wouldn&#8217;t use that as a generalization for all slaves, simply because you cannot prove it. I think that if you had shown ads that showed the differences in slaves, it would have made your thesis stronger, and more meaningful.</p>

			<p>Having read your post, I felt that you did a good job making the point that each slave had their own unique skills, which distinguishes them as humans at a more personal level. I agree with you that this is an important aspect that typical textbook articles on slavery lack. Also, I think it was interesting that you discussed the risk that the slave owners took by educating their slaves. Before I read this post, I did not really think about how the chances of slaves surviving on their own increases the more the slave owners teach them. I can imagine this caused psychological battles between the owners and the slaves, which leaves me to wonder how the slave owners kept the confidence level of the slaves low enough so that they were too scared to attempt to run away. </p>
<p>There were a few negative aspects of your post as well, including the fact that you failed to try to read into the personalities and motivations of the run-a-way slaves. You simply stated the obvious, which was that the slaves had different types of skills and physical appearances. Because of this, I feel that you lacked the analytical aspect that would make an exceptionally strong post. You could have discussed the ads that you read, and drawn conclusions to what the lives and motivations of the individual slaves were like. Other than these few points, your post was generally good, well structured and easy to read.</p>

			<p>I liked what you said about the Act that banned slavery outside of the United States. I had not previously known that. </p>
<p>Your thesis is very redundant to the facts of life. They were slaves, of course they had the desire for freedom in common. Another thing in your paper I took to read that slaves had most of the skills they had before they became slaves. I don&#8217;t see any proof of this. If a slave was appointed as a tailor or a musician, these skills would have to be taught to them. There were no fiddles in Africa at this time, so it would be impossible to know how to play one from the start. I just think if your thesis was different, the paper would have been much better overall.</p>

			<p>Your article was the best on this topic area, in my opinion. Your writing was not only informing, but very well written. Your beginning paragraph was probably the best. It states eloquently and succinctly your idea about the different types of slaves, and what their common interest is. You take a different approach to how slaves are seen and what their intentions are. </p>
<p>Finding something wrong with your paper was difficult. I think, however, that you could have used more fact based information throughout the article. You did in the first paragraph, but then it trailed off. Another area I found slightly off was your assumption that many slaves could read. From the information I have read, it seemed a large majority of slaves did not have the opportunity to learn how to read or actually knew how.</p>

			<p>In regards to this essay I am in total agreeance. I believe that some of the articles read really did begin to show that slaves were intelligent people. They possessed many valuable qualities just as any person does. Also, I loved that the point was made that slave owners risked loosing their slaves to other slave owners by revealing the things that the slaves were capable of. </p>
<p>One thing I believe could have made this essay little stronger was to include some specific instances of when a slave ran away and the qualities they possessed.</p>

			<p>It surprised me when you said that slaves were sometimes purposely not taught to read so if they did run away they wouldn’t be able to survive. Once I think about it though, it makes a lot of sense though. There was a lot of good information in this post, although I do think it was tedious to talk about slaves having children and grandparents when that is very much obvious. It’s really interesting to read about the different lives that slaves had when most people think that slaves had none.</p>

			<p>I really liked that you used your thesis statement twice in you blog.  I felt that it really helped the paper.  Not only did it help the paper, however it was just a really great thesis paragraph.  You put in a lot of interesting facts about slaves and a few i did not previously know.  One thing I kind of learned was that slaves run away alone.  Now I mean I knew this fact prior to reading this but i guess it never really clicked.  I know I couldnt do something like run away by myself.  Reading that really made it click in my head and it seems to brave for one of the slaves to leave all by themselves.  I felt that the third paragraph may have been unneccessary.  You talked about the articles that you had to read for the assignment but it seemed like it was just excessive information.</p>

			<p>Your post was very well written, even though you did not really support your thesis. We all tend to think slaves have no common education or talents. In fact this is very untrue. Your post explains to us that slaves do have a fairly decent education and they may possess special talents as well. Slaves were also human. It was quite interesting that some slave owners actually educated their slaves. I think that was very nice of them but at the same time, they were at risk. Their &#8220;educated&#8221; slave just might runaway and makes it out on their own. I mean its great but it surprises me that if the owner was “educated” and  trying to keep their slaves, didn’t it occur to them by educating them they could escape and will be able to survive on their own with the knowledge they had given them.<br />
Once again, it is sad how we have not learned about this side of slavery in past history classes. We only see one side of the slavery, when in reality there are many.<br />
I loved the way you ended your post, by using the quote that a slave didn’t have a choice of being a slave but they did have a choice to runaway to freedom, excellent quote. In the end, their fate was in their hands with the knowledge that they acquire while living with their master.</p>

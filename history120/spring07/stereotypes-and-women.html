			<div class="entry">
				<p>Stereotypes have been a part of the American culture since Englishmen first evaded the country. Stereotypes can be defined as “ideas held about members of particular groups, based solely on membership in that group” (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype">Wikipedia</a>). We are presented with these stereotypes everyday of our lives, and everyday we are pressured to embed these into our culture and lives. Some of the most common stereotypes have to do with women. Throughout history women have had very specific roles that they were forced to play and that is how society has come to portray women. <strong>The “cultural work” that stereotypes did in the nineteenth century is still the same work that is is doing today, which is cause society to view certain groups with these judegements in mind and creates room for even more stereotypes to be made.  </strong></p>
<p>I chose to focus my whole post on the sterotypes that women have and still face today. In my opinion, women have been one of the most discriminated groups in this country throughout  history. The common beliefs behind America was based around men and women struggled to compete. To this day, many women still struggle to maintain their own identities and to create a free life of their own. Consequently, the two stereotypes I focused on are “women are meant to be housewives” and that “being a nurse is a women’s job.”</p>
<p>One of the most significant stereotypes towards women is the fact that “ women are meant to be housewives.” During the nineteenth century, all that women were known for was being housewives and very few actually held positions other than this one. For example, the first picture is an advertisement that does a good job showing this stereotype (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/81916518@N00/430882476/in/photostream/">Housewife</a>). As the world is fighting the famine, her job, as she is a woman, has to do with providing food. In the second picture (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/81916518@N00/430876878/in/photostream/">Housewife 2</a>), we see a more modern day housewife with her duster in hand. The biggest difference between the two pictures is that the today’s housewife looks more worried about her make up then anything else. Which in turn yields the fact that today women not only are supposed to be housewives, but also are supposed to always look good and be ready for anything. As well, both women are seen wearing an apron, leading to that being a sign of cleaning. Both of these made life for women hard, whether in the nineteenth century, or today. It made it hard for women to be taken seriously, which makes it hard for them to break out of their shells and become workingwomen. Men view women as these objects at their disposal and view themselves as the powerhouse. All this in turn makes it hard for women to get jobs and be taken seriously. Though the biggest change in this stereotype is that as women then were silent and took their place, women now work hard to make something of themselves.</p>
<p>Women have always been seen as the nurse. In the nineteenth century, most doctors were men and most women were nurses. In the picture (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/81916518@N00/431024253/in/photostream/">Nurse</a>), we see that the woman is very happy to be a nurse and is the typical portrayal of a nurse. In the more modern drawing (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/81916518@N00/431024255/in/photostream/">Nurse 2</a>), the little girl is seen playing with her stuffed animal, nurse. This is showing that the stereotype of women being nurturing develops, as women are young children. They are trained to know their role and know that they are meant to be nurses.   In a way, this is stereotypical against men as well. It is saying that men who are nurses are gay and laughed at. For example, in the movie “Meet the parents” the main character is a nurse and is teased for it. As well, this stereotype shows that women are not meant to be doctors and shouldn’t be. The biggest reason that we connect women and nurses is because of the attributes we attribute to women. Women are known to be sweet, tender and caring. As well, they are lovable, sincere and sensitive. All these make women and nurses one. Coincedently that is why we choose to not attribute nurses as being male. Men who are nurses in turn are seen as sensitive and caring, making them look gay and foolish in guyish atmospheres.</p>
<p>            Throughout history women have been stereotyped against. It has been common knowledge that women are meant to be housewives and that only women were meant to be nurses. As a result, many more stereotypes can be formed just from these two alone. Not only can more stereotypes be formed, but also as a culture, we choose to view this group in this sense and think that they cannot be anything else.</p>

			<p>I think you did a good post here. Your comments about nursing are very true. My mom is a nurse, and they have it rough. Sometimes I wonder if the nurses have to work harder than the doctors.<br />
Great job.</p>

			<p>I agree that the stereotype that &#8220;women are meant to be housewives&#8221;, has been one of the most important stereotypes regarding women.  I think this stereotype is partly responsible for women not being able to get some of the same jobs as men.  Even today women are generally paid less than men in professional jobs, and this stereotype is partly to balm.  I do not agree that women were one of the most stereotyped groups in history.  Women were one of the groups most discriminated against, not stereotyped.</p>

			<p>Yes, stereotyping women is a very controversial topic.  It is obvious that women are still percieved inferior to men.  Even though we don&#8217;t stress how women should be &#8220;feminine&#8221; as much as we did in the past, they are still not equally judged as individuals.  A discussion I had in class the other day brought up the subject that men and women can be doing the same job or be in the same position at work, but women are still given a lesser paycheck.  This frustrates me because I feel like our society today has not done enough to change this misperception about women, even through all their success.</p>
<p>Your blog could be improved if you included some ways of what society can do to help this sexist stereotype that is still present today.  Your examples were very interesting, but it would have been even better if you added some ways to solve this problem.  How can we change the way we think of women to have certain jobs, such as nurses?  What can we do to approach and resolve this problem?  Your thoughts would have been interesting to read as well.  I enjoyed reading your blog!</p>

			<p>I found your blog very interesting. I agree with everything that you stated. When you mentioned the stereotype about women being nurses I too thought immediately of the movie, “Meet the Parents.” Especially about the part where Greg is made fun of over and over and then later asked to switch positions because he is a male nurse. This also happens in an episode of Scrubs when Elliot finds out that she is dating a male nurse. The stereotypes about women appear like they will never end. It sometimes seems like the only thing a woman can do is work harder and harder to prove that we can do just as well as a male.</p>

			<p>I liked your post and I thought you did a good job of picking out a specific stereotype and focusing on that. I thought you choosing to write about women was a good one to pick. Women have been stereotyped so much throughout history and sometimes I think that can be overlooked and you touched base on this very well. You did a nice job of showing how we label women with certain jobs and that it is less of a job if a man does it. It is wrong how we think women can only do certain jobs and can&#8217;t some jobs because they are not men. </p>
<p>Even though society and movies make fun of men being nurses like it makes them less of a man. I have a lot of friends that are in nursing school and no one thinks less of them or that it is just a womans job. Nursing has become such a growing interest because so many jobs are opening up. I would of maybe made a comment of how things are changing though from years back. Good post though.</p>

			<p>I really agree with you about the stereotyping of women. It is so obvious even in today&#8217;s society where a woman can do the same exact job as a man and be paid a lesser amount that this prejudice still exsists.</p>
<p>However, I do think we have made significant advancements. I do not think women are stereotyped into the role of housewife hardly at all in today society, except for extreme cases like the male chauvinists on shows like Maury Povich. Women are able to work in coroporate offices and still be mothers at the same time.</p>

			<p>I agree with you in the part were women are stereotyped again in that they are usually seen as housewives and have to be pretty, but I think thats just in our nature to be caring and sensitive. What girl doesn&#8217;t wanna look pretty and take care of her husband and kids?? But also, I think times have changed completely from back then, before it used to be that a women CAN&#8217;T get a job and isnt ALLOWED to vote but now women have as much a chance in making it as men do. There are many women doctors and many business women that have the same exact positions that men have. Lawyers, Doctors and Etc.</p>

			<p>This is a very good topic that you picked.  But i will have to disagree with you in some of the post because now a days women can choose weather to become a housewife or a working woman.  It is later on that they do make a choice on to becoming a house wife or a working women.  A good evidence is that the girl to guy ratio in GMU 55% women and 45% men so women are speaking up for themselves.  Now a days there are women who are becoming famous in the business world and they are speaking up for them selves.  How ever that is in America but back home in india it is true that women are told their role in life but however we are in america and women here do have a choice on to becoming a house wife or becoming someone.</p>

			<p>I felt this post gave two very strong examples of stereotypes in our culture. I liked how you showed the evolution of a womans duties from housewife to being dressed for anything. Something I felt could have made this point stronger was to talk about the roles women play today and business, and some of the stereotypes the modern day women run into. However I felt that you made the paragraph strong by ending with women have helped to change this stereotype by voice and their actions. </p>
<p>The second point made, about nurses was also very interesting. I like the examples you used, they kind of made me laugh, because it is true, men are looked down upon for being nurses, even though it is wrong. One thing I felt could have made this paragraph a little stronger was the rethink the statement about women being doctors. I don&#8217;t think that our society today says that women shouldn&#8217;t be doctors. In the medical world there seems to be a bit of the reverse going on. It seems to be ok for a women to go the extra step and become a doctor, but not ok for a man to do less and be a nurse. I felt this could possibly confuse some readers because it kind of talks about the reverse sexism, although I find it very interesting. It shows that not only women are discriminated against, which is a little counterproductive to your argument. Which leads to the existance of discrimination of men today. It seems today women are more times than not, having the upper hand. In the miliatary for instance, my dad had said, when they take tests for advancement, a man and woman competing for the same advancement with the same score, the woman ususally receieves the promotion. Something interesting to think about, is our society participating in a reverse form of sexism now?</p>

			<p>I love how you focused your point on Women and sterotypes surrounding then. Women are one of the most discriminated groups.  Although, I am not a feminist, I am for the equality of women to men.  However, when comparing sexes, there are jobs that women do better, along with jobs that men do better. In my personal opinion, being a housewife is one of the most rewarding jobs out there. That is my dream, I dream to be mother and wife. However, I do not feel that that is all I can do. Obviously, I am doing something with my life since I am in college.  I think in the passed few decades though, that we have looked down upon the typical housewife, saying that it is a job anyone could do. Very good post!! Well done!!</p>

			<p>I agree with you that one of the most central stereotypes for women have been that they should be homemakers and housewives but this stereotype is not as prevalent as it was in previous times in the past.  What I liked about your post is that you stuck to a specific stereotype and centered on that. You’re right in the sense that the society does tend to brand women with particular jobs. I agree with someone else, maybe you should have mentioned some ideas that we as a society could implement to erase this problem from society.</p>

			<p>Your choice to look at the stereotypes of Women is, in my opinion, a good one.  Even if everyone were from the same culture (i.e. &#8220;race&#8221;), we would still have stereotyping of women.  The stereotyping of women is probably traceable as far back as we can go in history, simply because of the innate differences between men and women.</p>
<p>I REALLY liked how you showed that stereotypes are often like a yin/yang difference between cultures. For example, the stereotype that &#8220;White men can&#8217;t jump&#8221; carries with it the inherent implication that Blacks are better at jumping.</p>
<p>Besides a few grammatical errors, I can find nothing negative to say about your post.</p>

			<p>I think you have very good thesis, and you also follow your thesis and talk about it. I really like you pick one specific stereotype and focusing on that makes a lot argument. Women I think were the most important stereotype throughout history.  Women may do same job as man, however, they didn’t get same mount money as man. When we think about women, they always stay home and take his child. I do agree the reason women be like this because the society had s lot do with it. If women want to change this position I think we should change our society first. You really did good job on this blog, you also add some link for us know more about how women live back then. I really like you blog and it’s well done.</p>

			<p>This is a very well written post.  I liked how in depth you went into one stereotype.  Everybody else used multiple stereotypes and you used one, which is a good switch.  I like that because I got to learn more about the topic because that topic was told throughout the whole post.  I like how you did that.  Also, I really liked your thesis statement.  Its really easy to follow and allows that reader to easily understand what it is you are trying to argue.  I agree with everything you say about women and how there still getting stereotyped from the past.  My mom is a nurse and I here her complain all the time stressing how much work she does and all that stuff.  All in all, women are judged differently and I like how you focused on that and used many good examples to prove that.<br />
I think you could&#8217;ve stated a couple ways in which we can solve this problem and the ways we have been solving this problem.  For instance, women are allowed to vote now.  Just some of those examples could&#8217;ve been a great counter-argument for your idea.</p>

			<p>The post was very intersting. You explained the the gerneral sterotypes society has on women. Your thesis was very strong and you supported it in your body. Your visuals were a nice touch, well thought out. The house wife in the dress looking her best, the nurse in the white outfit, the dust fan all show     symbols of a sterotype which has follwed women from the last century. Overall your blog was written and supported very well. I enjoyed reading your work and found it very enlightning.</p>

			<p>Your organization for this post was very good. The way way you structured the post so that it flowed from one thought to the another, made the entire post interesting to read. By focusing on Housewives and Nurses as forms of sterotypes for women i think you made the post stronger. Other sterotypes could possibly be seen differntly, but i think everybody would agree, the ones you chose were very good. If you could focus on small area of your writing, i think you could shorten some of your thoughts and sentences, by adding them together or taking out unneseccary words. Besides that it was an excellent post.</p>

			<p>I like in this post how you focused on 2 stereotypes of the housewife and as the nurse. It is an interesting progression how a matriarchal character can be misconstrued into the many &#8220;caretaker&#8221; personas of women in the mass media over these years. The stereotype of &#8220;men as doctors, women as nurses&#8221; I think is still very much around today.</p>

			<p>I think you did a great job on your post. I don’t think that I have any suggestions to improve your post. I liked how you focused on stereotypes for woman and used different stereotypes that woman possess. I think that women do have the stereotype of staying home and being the housewife, and men think that woman are below then for that. But I think that being a housewife is harder then any other job that any man could hold.</p>

			<p>I thought your post was very interesting. I completely agree that women are stereotyped. I liked your example of the nurse.   If a man was known to be a nurse, they would be teased for it. Do they really see nursing as a meaningless and easy job? That man is too good to be nurses. It is extremely sad that if women were to have the same qualities a man possessed and the same position as him, we know that she would still be getting paid less than him.<br />
I have to say woman have come a long way though. We are not just housewives but can also maintain jobs and help the man with the income. I still believe we have a long way to go to be at their level and be treated the same.<br />
Overall, I think you had an excellent post. It was very well written and well organized. Good post!</p>

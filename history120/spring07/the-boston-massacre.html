			<div class="entry">
				<p><strong>While looking at the module depicting an image of the Boston Massacre, it is clear to see the bias shown against the British, and that the physical state of the British and Americans were very different.</strong> The module paints a clear picture for us to visualize the Boston Massacre itself, with such details as where people standing and what it is they are doing. You can see that Captain Preston, the British commander, is standing behind all of his men cheering them on, but not actually fighting himself, or standing in the line of danger. His troops are in a line infront of him all firing their guns at the Americans. The crowd itself is not nearly as organized as the British troops are, in both appearance and actions. They appear to be unarmed, nor are they fighting back, but tending to ones already shot by the British troops. It seems to be early evening, as you can see a small cresent moon in the upper left-hand corner.</p>
<p>One problem with the history of certain events, is that they most often are told from a specific view point, and are therefore biased in some way, shape, or form. By looking at this particular module, it seems Revere wants his viewers to interpret the Boston Massacre as the British making a surprise attack on unarmed Americans, and blatantly making the British out to be the bad guys. With that being said, Revere has also made the American&#8217;s appear disorganized by depicting them as a giant mob of people, instead of the organized line the British are standing in. To take it one step further, one could say that this particular group of American&#8217;s in Boston are not very patriotic because they do not appear to be actively fighting for their independence from Britain. Because Revere has created this picture, he obviously had a specific story he wanted to tell. Depending on wether it was a British or an American, others may tell the story a completely different way. </p>
<p>Although this module does tell a particular story from a particular point of view, that doesn&#8217;t mean that it is not credible. It is simply a portrayal of a part of history, which could very well be accurate. With so many different things going on in the picture, there are many ways to interpret what Revere is trying to depict, some being more obvious than others.</p>

			<p>I think your blog was very straightforward, and mostly correct. Yes, portrayal of history often goes to the winners. I would think that that picture wouldn&#8217;t be as famous as it is if the patriots didn&#8217;t win the Revolution. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I would have called the American group in the picture a &#8220;mob,&#8221; just a group of people. Also, you should notice that the picture and the event are both dated in 1770, four or five years before talk of independence.</p>

			<p>It was hard to comment on your blog because you did not put a link to the depiction of the the Boston Massacre. It was also hard because you did not specify who wrote the article. Was the person British or American? While I do know the answer, how could I know what depiction it was? Then it was vaguely stated the Revere had made the depiction, but you did not fully state his name or where he was from. It seems like it would be common sense for me to know this, and I do, but it is hard for people to comment when all the information has not been presented.<br />
I do agree with many of your points. The depiction was not common war depictions because it was not a militia or army fighting against the British, but townspeople caught unaware of what was happening. What was worse, there are women caught in the middle, this is not normal for war depictions at all. One point I do not agree on was the point that the American people were not actively fighting for there independence. I believe it is hard to fight when you are unarmed and a militia is standing in a line shooting at friends and family.</p>

			<p>Just looking at the picture myself, it’s obviously clear that the American troop seems to be not as motivated as the British groups. Also, it looks like the British troops seems to be doing all the fighting while the American troops are just looking at them or helping the people that are wounded on their side. They mentioned that the British commander was not participating in the fight and to me, it seems like it’s in common because if the British commander was participating in the fight, then who will lead the troops? Just looking at the picture, I wouldn’t know why the American troops are not fighting back. The picture seems very realistic because of the setting where the fighting began. </p>
<p>This post was very thought out and explained the picture very clearly. Although there is no right or wrong answer, they included every detail that was shown in the picture. I agree that the artist who drew this painting is painting from their point of view. We do not know if we are looking at an American point of view or British point of view. Who ever‘s view it is, it does make the American troops bad.</p>

			<p>I totally agree with you on most of the points that you are trying to make. Definitely I think that whomever is to create the painting will make the painting appear a certain way to his/her advantage. Us being as naive as we are living in this day in age will take it to mean exactly how the painting portrays it. We tend to forget that paintings come with such bias and only focus on a one sided point of view. Your description of how the British and Americans were described was just about what I had noticed. </p>
<p>Overall, I think that your blog was really good and it made a lot of sense. You did a really good job describing to people what was in the painting. That was a good thing on your part because for people who had not seen it would have a good sense of what you are talking about. If I were to offer you some advice I would say that maybe you could elaborate on one aspect a little more. You said, “He obviously had a specific story he wanted to tell.” Maybe you could talk a little more about what you think he meant. Other than that, really cool blog!</p>

			<p>I really enjoyed this blog because you did exactly what the assignment asked for.  A picture can relate to many different things, intepretations, and even views.  You took the picture and described it with many details, which is not always easy to do.  I can relate to the picture even more now after looking at the picture and reading what you have written and even some of the questions I had for the picture you had answered so good job.</p>
<p>The only critisism I have is that the details seemed kind of basic and it seemed like you didn&#8217;t take the details to the next level. I agree that you have a lot of details and most of them are great, but almost all of them are only one sentence or a phrase long.  Maybe next time you could go into more explanation of the detail so the reader can fully understand what it is you are trying to prove.</p>

			<p>The British are portrayed as horrible and commanding people.  They obviously feel that they are superior to the Americans since the image shows that they are in control.  Pictures similar to these can portray false illustrations.  However, it is interesting to see how the British or the Americans really thought about their past.  It is obvious that the illustrator wanted viewers to side with their view on the past, so they make it seem more brutal and extreme than it really was.  It is important to refer to reliable texts so we are careful to make our own justified perspectives.  </p>
<p>I thought your post was interesting.  However, you should have made your conclusion longer since it does overview and conclude all the points you have made previously.  I disagree that the picture shows Americans as disorganized.  I thought that the British were portrayed evil.  The Americans didn&#8217;t know of the attack so it was more out of their control than being unprepared.  Overall, I enjoyed reading your post.  Even though images can be unreliable at times, I feel it is important since it gives people a chance to illustrate their own opinions and how they perceive the world.</p>

			<p>It is hard to give my point of view of the picture you are speaking of since you did not put a link to it. Other than that your blog was well-written and organized.<br />
I agree with your statement that most history is taught in a some what biased point of view. I agree that the British in the picture are being portrayed as evil attackers on the Americans and I even agree with you that the Americans could possibly be being portrayed as un-patriotic since they are just standing there frightened. However, I must put myself in that predicament. If you were unarmed and being attacked by those with massive firepower, you too would probably pray they have mercy on you. This is unfair of the British to do since it is not a fair and just fight. Also you made a small point that Captain Preston was standing behind his troops not fighting at all. This seems to be true of most commanders haha. Yes, they are important and need mostly to not die, but he is fighting unarmed men and I believe that he is just as capable as fighting as the other men; he is not any better than they are that they deserve to die first. If the picture wanted to depict him as a great Captain, they should have painted him fighting bravely; not hiding behind his men.</p>

			<p>I thought that this blog was fairly clear, and you brought up some interesting points that are not necessarily that obvious at first glance.  I agree that Revere is trying to make the British soldiers seem like the bad guys when the history behind this particular event in not exaclty that black and white.<br />
From the picture it seems to me that the British soldiers are not actually shooting Americans in cold blood.  They look fairly pissed off and the expression on the commanders face almost seems to have a hint of anxiety in it.  I would not say that the commander is cheering his soldiers on.</p>

			<p>I think your post was very well organized. You gave a lot of details to back your claims. A good example is when you said, &#8220;&#8230;the American’s appear disorganized by depicting them as a giant mob of people, instead of the organized line the British are standing in.&#8221; I also agree that the artist depicts the picture in his point of view, trying to make the viewer feel a certain way when looking at it.</p>
<p>However, I do think you could have provided a link to the part you are disscussing. Also, you should add an introduction instead of coming out and stating your thesis right away. This would help the overall structure of your blog.</p>

			<p>I agree with you that history is often told from only one point of view, and that this is a problem. Yet, we can still find truth in biased opinions, which is why it is important to analyze the views and lives of everyone involved. In this case, involving a painting of the Boston massacre, we have to realize that paintings are not always intended to tell the literal truth, but to simply send a message. Even though we can see from the picture that Revere made the British look like the bad guys, we cannot assume this is true from the painting itself. We must remember that this painting is nothing more than the view of one man, which I think you did a good job making clear. </p>
<p>Also, I think you did a good job of explaining the details of what was happening in the picture, in that I believe someone would understand what you were talking about even if they had not seen the painting. On the other hand, you still should have included a hyperlink to the image itself. In addition, you could have taken your descriptions of the painting to the next level, and elaborated on what you thought was the meaning was behind the details. Anyone can look at a painting and describe what they see, so it would have made your post much better if you further discussed your personal interpretations of the painting. There are reasons why Revere painted the painting the way he did that could give insight on his thoughts and motivations.</p>

			<p>This is very interesting blog. You told us a lot of information about Boston Massacre, and also you add something into your writing, what did you feel about Boston Massacre. Even some people didn’t see picture before. Though your blog people actually can what was going on back then. You described it with many detail. After I saw picture about Boston Massacre, I storage agree with you. Unarmed American got killed by British troops. However, American still fights back.<br />
If you can add picture link into your writing, it will make your blog even better. So people can really see it, and compare with your writing, Also if you need discussed more about your personal interpretation of the painting. Over all this is very good blog, this blog well detail.</p>

			<p>I liked how you gave a good description of the picture and made the reader really be able to picture it in their minds. It was a good point that you made that when you look at pictures that most of the time for pictures like this that the artist usually does have a bias towards one side and wants the audience to be able to picture it the way he wants to. It was good how you pointed out how the British were made out to be the bad guys and from your descriptions that I can really picture it in my head with the british soldiers attacking an american group and how it all went down.</p>
<p>The only thing I wised you did was provide a link to the picture so I could see where you were getting your information from. Even though you did a good job of describing it, providing a link to the picture would of made the post even better so we could see where you were coming from.</p>

			<p>The way you described the picture was really good because it made me visualize it better. I agree with you that the artist does tend to want the readers to see the picture in their view. </p>
<p>I also would have liked to view the picture that you wrote about, so if you had provided a link that would have been helpful. That would definetly have helped me in understandig your descriptions and how you arrived at those conclusions.</p>

			<p>True, you could analyze Revere&#8217;s picture in several ways, but I don&#8217;t think that making the Americans look bad is one of the ways that you could look at it. Paul Revere was not a loyalist in any way, and I seriously doubt that he would deliberately depict Americans to be lesser than the British in any other way than to gain sympathy. And just because the Americans aren&#8217;t fighting back, that doesn&#8217;t make them unpatriotic. I know that if I was unarmed and in a crowd of people who were being shot at, I would certainly not fight back without means of protecting myself.</p>

			<p>I think your writing is clear and organized. First of all, you did really well describing the picture. Your description visualize the painting very well so that those people who have not seen it also can know what is going on the picture.<br />
I also liked your interpretations of the painting saying that the artist portrayed the British as bad guys. I agree with you that there is somewhat bias in this painting. The artist painted this in his point of view so that of course, there was bias. An art of work usually contains viewpoint of the artist toward an object or an event. The artist created his work in his perspective, and he could not be objective even if it was a historical event.<br />
Overall, your writing is well written. However, there is one thing that I disagree with you. I do not think that Boston are not patriotic just because they were not fight against Britain. Other than that, I really enjoyed  and was very interested in your writing.</p>

			<p>Your thesis statement was very well written and covers everything that you wrote about in you blog post.  You are correct when it comes to bias in modules and that the artists decide what they want you to see.  I would have been better if there was a link embedded in your post so that I can nod my head &#8220;yes&#8221; or shake my head &#8220;no&#8221; to what you wrote.  But since there wasn&#8217;t, I had to base by conclusions off of your bias in the modules.  By actually looking at the modules that you were writting about, I could see with my own eyes what you posted on or find things that might be relative to your post that you may have missed.<br />
However, with the examples that you gave us, and the example that was provided in class with George Washington crossing the Delaware, I would have to agree with your post and the biases in the modules.</p>

			<p>Your post was well written and made very clear points. I agree with you that they made the British the bad guys, and by making Americans look disoriented I think that he wanted some people to feel bad for them like the British caught them off guard. I think that some of the points that he made may have been true, like having the British army look so put together and the American so scrambled. The British have been fighting for many years and this was something fairly new to the Americans.</p>

			<p>I agree with your point that historical depictions are going to be biased based on which perspective is being shown. Revere    does use this to elicit certain emotions against the British.</p>
<p>One point that I think you missed was that the Americans were not troops at all, but civilians. If you connected this to your thesis, the civilians depicted not fighting back is used as a technique by Revere to show that there was no reason for the soldiers to kill those Americans, showing the British as merciless killers and that the British are oppressive upon the American people. Their organized straight line can also be seen as machine-like and inhuman, further alienating American viewers of this depiction from the British. Furthermore, the Captain is not cheering on his troops, he is giving the order to fire which was the technique of the British in war.</p>
<p>The Boston Massacre did NOT take place during the Revolutionary War. It took place BEFORE it. There was no American army at the time of the Boston Massacre.</p>

			<p>I do agree that paintings like this are often painted to the bias of the winner, but I think that this one was painted to make the British look more insufferable so that Colonial Americans would want to fight against them even more. It was a very good use of propaganda for the Americans to use. Good job at explaining what is going on in this painting and even using some know names.</p>

			<p>This blog makes no sense!!  The thesis, even though I can kind of understand what the author is trying to say needs to be reworded drastically.  The first part of the thesis is pretty good, and is adequately discussed later throughout the blog.  The second part of the thesis is the problem , the author describes the “physical state” of the Americans and British as being very different.  This statement is apparent to anyone that can see, however the author does not go into detail later in the paper telling us what these differences in “physical states” might mean.  Rather it goes on to describe the positioning of the people in the picture, instead of telling us the possible deeper meaning of these “physical states”.<br />
The blog eventhough I think it may have had a few fixable structural errors can still be salvaged.  The author makes a very good point in reminding us that all history in one way or another is biased.</p>

			<p>Overall, I felt that this essay was hard to follow. Without the links I had to create an image in my mind, which wasn&#8217;t so difficult. I fully understood the interpretation of the picture as being the &#8216;good&#8217; guys and &#8216;bad&#8217; guys. Also I felt that it was wise to say that all historical depictions have some kind of biases towards what is being depicted.</p>
<p>One thing I felt was weak in this essay was the obvious interpretation of the picture with the &#8216;good&#8217; guys and the &#8216;bad&#8217; guys. Although to some extent this interpretation is probably true I felt that some other conclusions could be drawn. From reading this essay I would have possibly said that the artist may have been depicting the character of each of the sides. For example, the fact that the Americans were helping the wounded could have been to symbolize their fighting as a true work for their general warfare, while the British, obviously being led by a air head leader simply want to rule by force and keep themselves in control.</p>

			<p>I thought your article was very interesting. I think that you were very clear and insightful in how you articulated your viewpoints. I think that you are absolutely correct in your identification of history as biased. It has been said by numerous people that history is written by the winners. The one aspect of your blog, that I disagreed with, was your interpretation of Revere&#8217;s depiction of the event. Historically, as a pro-American entity, I think it was clear that he was trying to portray peaceful American colonist. The picture would be saying that the British are &#8220;bullies&#8221;, trying to exert their force on unarmed defenseless colonist.</p>

			<p>You make a good point about the portrayal of the massacre as a &#8220;surprise attack.&#8221;  There is an obvious contrast from the organized, almost premeditated formation of the British soldiers, to the uncoordinated shock and horror of the colonists.  </p>
<p>I like also how you discuss the spin factor of a portrayal (writing, pictures, oral, etc.) of history by one side or another.</p>
<p>In an effort to aid you in the writing of further posts, I would suggest a double-checking of grammar.  The first paragraph is missing an &#8220;are&#8221; in one place and has an extra one in another.  &#8220;Nor&#8221; is used incorrectly once.  These types of errors are easy to miss when writing, but finding them and changing them is key to raising the grammar of your writing up to the high standards you have set with your solid argument.</p>

			<p>All in all it is a very well written post. A link to the picture would have been helpful, however I feel you did a very good job of explaining the biased position that Revere would have had towards the event. The only thing I would recomend working on would be your word choices. For example you use the word &#8220;module&#8221; 3 times in referring to Revere&#8217;s picture, a simple change such as referring to it as something different more then just the 1 time would add to your post.</p>

			<p>You did a good job in analyzing the picture however it would have been a bit more helpful putting a link to the picture itself.  You definately explained how biased the picture was quite well.</p>
<p>The one thing that i disagree with you on is your idea that Revere is trying to show his viewers that the British surprise attacked the Americans.  Although the image may look that way, the phrase &#8220;surprise attack&#8221; just does not seem to work.</p>

			<p>Your post a good beginning. Your description is good and shows good details. It would have been better if you had added a picture to support you claim. Your overall thesis was good and your supporting body was complete. Your point about the views  history and the way they are told is very good, I agree with this as they are told from a certain point of view. I enjoyed reading your blog and your supporting body. It would have made a big impact if you had added a picture to back up your claim. Over all good job.</p>

			<p>I think your post was interesting and very well written. I have to say I agree with you that someone portraying something through painting, writing, etc, will portray in the way he/or she views it. When looking at these kinds of things for example, the image of the Boston Massacre we need to take this to account. We cannot take sides because it could be biased and we need to understand this.<br />
I also like liked how you describe the image with many great details. You did a good job and overall I enjoyed reading your post. A link to the image would have been made your post even better.</p>

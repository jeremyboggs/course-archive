				<p>There are only a few select movies that can withstand the test of time. When you think of movies that fit this category you might come up with “Star Wars”, “Titanic”, “Gladiator”, other movies similar to these. Very few movies can incorporate history, and comedy, and in my opinion survive this test better then “Monty Python and the Holy Grail”. <strong>Although it does it in a silly and humorous manner, “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” manages to incorporate many elements, legends, and styles of living in medieval England.</strong></p>
<p>First it is important to understand that this movie is not meant to be taken seriously at all, therefore while it depicts aspects of medieval England, but does it in a way to get you to laugh. With that in mind, let’s look at one of the most famous scenes from the movie. Anyone who has ever scene this movie can, and most likely will, start rambling off quotes from the scene where King Arthur and his knights come to the French castle. This scene of course is completely ridiculous, and nothing like this probably ever happened, however it does call into play something that was happening for many hundreds of years, and that is the fact that around this time period the English and the French did not get along at all, which stretched up through the time of the American Revolution. Another aspect of the time period that is portrayed, again in a way to make you laugh, is the black plague. While the scene from the movie takes this all very lightly, the black plague was one of the most devastating epidemics in human history. Another very important part of medieval England is their strong religious ties. The entire movie is centered around God telling King Arthur and his knights to go on a quest to find the “holy grail”. The scene in the movie where god comes and talks to King Arthur and his knights is priceless. God appears to talk to them, and then proceeds to yell at them for graveling at first, then for apologizing to him, and then for averting their eyes from him.</p>
<p>The movie also covers many of the legends from medieval England. The biggest one is the actual legend of King Arthur. It is highly speculated that King Arthur was entirely made up, and its sole purpose is to portray the way a king should rule during both war, and peace. It is said that Arthur’s table of knights was round so that everyone who sits at it is equal since there is no head of the table. Of the knights that sat at this table, Sir Bedivere, Sir Galahad, and Sir Lancelot, are all in the movie with King Arthur. Knights mentioned in the movie that I could find no proof of being at the round table however were Sir Robin, and Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film. Another big legend is the legend of the “holy grail”. According to the legend the “holy grail” is the dish, plate or cup used by Jesus at the last supper, and is said to possess miraculous powers. There is also a reference to a classical legend in this movie. Most people are familiar with the Trojan Horse legend from ancient Greece. Well in this movie Arthur and his knights attempt their own take on this classic myth to gain entrance to the French castle, only instead of using a horse they use a rabbit. Of course this is all outrageously false, but is mainly used to create just another comical element to the movie.</p>
<p>Life in England at this time is also shown in this movie, but in such a way as to come off as comical. For example, as King Arthur rides through the town in the opening scene of the movie one peasant asks another who he, referring to Arthur, is. The other peasant responds he must be a king, and when asked to explain how he knew this he responds “well he isn’t covered in shit”. This isn’t entirely accurate, although medieval England was not a good place to live if you were a peasant. Another one of the most famous scenes from this movie shows you another, less common aspect of life at this time. The famous black knight was something that one might encounter in England during these times. A black knight was simply a knight that had no liege, or a knight that was too poor to afford armor, and therefore painted their armor black in order to prevent it from rusting. A major historical inaccuracy in this movie is the witch scene, in which a peasant woman is being accused of being a witch. She is then put on a semi trial in which she is weighed against a duck to find out if she would float on water. In the end she winds up weighing the same as the duck and is therefore concluded to be a witch. However during these times there were no witch hunts, and in fact there were laws passed against believing in witchcraft at all.</p>
<p>All in all “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” might not be one of the most historically accurate movies of all time, it certainly offers a comical look into medieval England. At the rate it is going “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” might very well wind up being one of the movies that withstands the test of time, and continues to entertain generations to come.</p>

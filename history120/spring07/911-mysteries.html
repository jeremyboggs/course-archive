			<div class="entry">
				<p>As super paranoid, anti-(current) government, believer of conspiracy theories, I have exhausted the internet of conspiracy videos. After the horrific attacks upon our country on 9/11 I began to speculate more and more whether or not our own people were responsible for the tragedies. I watched hours upon hours of film, and read pages among pages of research on the topics at hand that could possibly shine some light on what really happened. It was not until I stumbled upon a video entitled <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6708190071483512003">&#8220;9-11 Mysteries&#8221;,</a>Â  that everything all became so horrifically apparent. <strong>While the government may still deny any involvement in the attacks on September 11th, this video makes it almost undeniable that there is some sort of cover up going on.</strong></p>
<p>The video, produced by a man name Brad, a conservative republican, is possibly the most scientifically analyzed approach at the topic. For Brad, the journey to conspiracy began actually when he viewed another documentary on the subject. &#8220;Painful Truths of 9-11&#8243; by Eric Huffschmidt was what set him out on his quest. Brad was determined to prove the documentary wrong, and along the way of his research he realized that it was actually the official report released by the government that was shrouded in lies and not the documentary. While the video does claim that the falling of the twin towers was not caused by the explosions of the planes that crashed in to the building, it does not point any fingers at anyone. Rather it leaves the opinion part up to the viewer to decide.</p>
<p>Even though the video is and hour and forty five minutes long, it keeps you captivated by the continual presentation scientific supported claims. The official FEMA and PBS documentaries are explained and then challenged, but again, no fingers are pointed to who did what, the video just shows you that what we are being told is not the truth and something is being covered up. The video uses a barrage of science and understanding to essentially show you the whole picture of what happened. Facts like the melting point of steel, the enormous core of the towers that just disappears, and comparisons of other steel structure that burned for 24 hours and were still standing were just some of the things that gave me a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach about what was going on. More over, the big business men involved in what happened, and their actions pre and post 9-11 were completely unreal. It is almost as if they have sold their souls to the devil.</p>
<p>I think that anyone that cares about the future of our country, anyone that may have lost friends or family because of horrible tragedies like this, anyone who is even alive should watch this video. It may be the one thing that changes your mind about how you perceive the men and women that supposedly represent your country. America seems to be getting pulled out of underneath our own feet, and soon enough we will all realize, but will it be too late?</p>

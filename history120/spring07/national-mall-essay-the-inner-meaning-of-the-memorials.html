			<div class="entry">
				<p>Countless number of people and events have been involved in our history. Among many people and events, there are the great heroes and the unforgettable events that strongly have affected our country. We do not want to forget our heroes. We rather want to memorize and honor them because they are the ones who have led our nation to this place today. The National Mall really reflects those ideas. <strong>The form of each memorial or monument on the National Mall shows how our ancestors have lived, how our country has developed, and finally answers where we came from by symbolizing their true meaning.</strong></p>
<p>I chose Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, and World War II Memorial. The reason that I chose Washington Monument is that it is a well-known American landmark and a symbol of the capital of the United States, Washington, D.C. The Washington Monument was built to remember the work and life of the first president of the United States, George Washington. George Washington earned the title “Father of our Country” in his leadership that caused American Independence. People of the United States show their respect toward George Washington throughout Washington Monument. The form of Washington Monument is obelisk, and the base of the monument is surrounded by fifty flags. The flags represent the 50 states of the Union. It reminds us Washington as a founding father of all the 50 states. Also, no other building in D.C. is taller than Washington Monument, and it stands at the heart of city. Once again, it shows the gratitude of people of the United States to the father of their country.</p>
<p>Lincoln Memorial honors the 16th president of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. I chose Lincoln memorial because the design of the memorial embodied liberty, equality, and unity in one structure. The building is in the form of a Greek Doric temple. Inside of the building, there are a seated sculpture of Abraham Lincoln and inscription of two speeches by Lincoln. The cavernous chamber shows a peaceful portrait of the greatness of the single man. The seated statue of Lincoln shows his belief that all people should be free and equal. When we look at the outside of the temple, we can see that the memorial is surrounded by 36 Doric columns, one for each of the thirty six states in the Union at the time of Lincoln’s death. Their names are on the frieze directly above. The columns surrounding the temple show unity of the states.</p>
<p>World War II memorial honors the more than 16 million who served in the United States armed forces during the WWII. The design of the Memorial symbolizes various aspects of the war representing unity, sacrifice, victory and freedom. First of all, at the western side of the memorial, the Freedom Wall contains 4000 commemorative gold stars, one for each 100 Americans who died in battle during World War II, and they show sacrifice of WWII. Secondly, the circular form of Rainbow Pool in the middle of WWII memorials, and the pillar surrounding it shows unity. Thirdly, the 56 pillars are adorned with bronze wreath represent unity and victory of country. There are also bas-relief panels depict scene from the World War II. By showing scene of battle, the panels commemorate the soldiers who fought in the war.</p>
<p>The unique design of Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, and World War II Memorial have their roots in earlier European architecture and also have their own symbolic meanings. The great American heroes and the important historical events harmonize with earlier European design to show our common heritage and the diverse culture that is our source of renewal. Moreover, the specific design of each memorial make people to think about what its true meanings is. While we explore the meanings of the specific look of each monument, we learn more about our history and know where we came from.</p>

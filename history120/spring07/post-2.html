				<p><strong>Images can be very useful for historians to determine one side&#8217;s feelings towards an event in history.</strong> For example, <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/exploring/18thcentury/bostonmassacre/assignment.php">this picture</a>, by Paul Revere, of the Boston Massacre portrays the American&#8217;s view of what happened there. The British commander is standing behind his troops giving them the orders almost as if he is unwilling to do any of the dirty work himself. The British troops are in front of a building with a sign that reads &#8220;Butchers House&#8221; on it suggesting that they are &#8220;butchering&#8221; the Americans. The American&#8217;s in this picture out number the British about 2-1. However the Americans are not fighting back against the British. Also the fight is happening in the middle of a street, in front of a church, at night. This helps to portray the British as evil since its in front of a church, and at night.</p>
<p>Paul Revere uses this picture to depict the British as evil, and probably to help gain support from the colonists for the revolution. The British are firing on people that are completely defenseless, that show no signs of instigation, and who are not fighting back. Revere even changes the name of the building they are in front of from custom house to Butchers house. The leader of the British troops is standing there calling out orders to his men, encouraging them to continue to add to the violence. All of this adds to the idea that Revere wanted this to appear as brutal, and as uncalled for as possible. Pictures such as this suggest that revolutionary leaders were very creative in their attempts to gain support for their cause. It also serves to illustrate one potential view of this event. The reason that there may be several different accounts of an event like this is because people tend to exaggerate stories to make actions resulting from it seem more justified. Phenomena like this can help historians to begin to realize how stories can spread and create more support for actions, and how historical events can be altered to show one side more negatively then the other.</p>

			<p>Like another post, you are straightforward in your answers to the questions. (Sorry, I reply to these from newest to oldest, hence why you get the &#8220;once again&#8221; instead of the later post.)  I liked that you pointed out that that this viewpoint was used to draw support for the coming revolution, much like propaganda adds of World War 2. There really isn&#8217;t anything bad about your argument that I can see. Some spelling mistakes here and there, but no much else.</p>

			<p>I like your point that Paul Revere put this in a biased prospective in order to initiate Americans protest to the British. I think what everyone needs to get from this is that Paul Revere was trying to put this in a negative light against the British in order to sway the people that were indifferent to the cause to be for the revolution. He wanted to show how cold hearted the British were in order to make this revolution a fight between the common people of America and the tyrants in Britain. You did a good job illustrating these points. I also agree that the historians look at this as just another viewpoint and give critism as well as get an indepth view of what may have happened.<br />
Some things I think you can work on for your edit is creating a clear beginning, middle, and end to your paper. It kind of drops us off in the middle of your argument. You had a good paper just needs a little tweaking. Also, give us why the Boston Massacre occured and how Paul Revere&#8217;s depiction reached the people and how they reacted.</p>

			<p>Absolutely this was a tactful usage of an image by Paul Revere. He was a very motivated man and in a sense was very creative like you said. The picture really shows how Revere was such an “instigator.” He knew what he had to do, and apparently he knew just how to get it. I am sure that thousands of Americans were swayed as a result of this ad and were ready to fight for the cause. It really helped make people hate the British. The picture really shows a one sided view of the whole Boston Massacre ordeal. </p>
<p>Your blog was good. I like how you really explained your interpretation of the picture in good detail. As well, as a result of your piece, I learned a couple new aspects and interpretations of the picture, which was really awesome to me. Maybe you could have elaborated more on each of your points to make it even clearer. For example you said, “Revere even changes the name of the building they are in front of from custom house to Butchers house.” I think that you could talk more about the significance of this. Other than that, blog was good!</p>

			<p>I totally agree with you that images hold views for one particular person, or a group that agree on similar views.  Because of this, pictures such as these are not reliable.  Even when I look at historical cartoons, I find it hard to believe the events happened the way it is illustrated to us.  I do know through facts, that Britain did treat the Americans as if they were inferior to them.  However, is it as brutal as it is portrayed in the image?  For example, if you were just hearing one side of an argument, can you get reliable justifications?  I doubt it.  This picture was obviously from the American&#8217;s point of view.  If the British were to make a cartoon, they would most likely show a different perspective on things.</p>
<p>I liked the image you chose to prove your thesis.  You followed through with your thesis statement throughout your blog.  However, I think you should have organized this post more sufficiently.  By that I mean that you should have had at least three paragraphs.  I can not tell if you are trying to support or conclude your thesis in your second paragraph.  Overall I enjoyed reading your post!</p>

			<p>I completely agree with you that Revere used this depiction in order to depict the British as evil. He definitely wanted Americans to feel a certain way towards the British when they looked at the picture. I also think it is very true that he used certain details, like the name of the store, to help make the British look evil. Although it is true that the British are not justified in killing people, Revere definitely used the ad as a means to influence people, and Revere did not seem to care if he had all the details right or not.</p>
<p>The main critizism I have is that your blog is not very well organized. You need an introduction paragraph.  Also, the second paragraph seems somewhat like a conclusion, but you also bring up new facts, like the part about the British commander, which you should not do in a conclusion. Overall it was good though and I did really like the conclusion sentence you used when you said, &#8220;Phenomena like this can help historians to begin to realize how stories can spread and create more support for actions, and how historical events can be altered to show one side more negatively then the other.&#8221;</p>

			<p>i agree that this picture is really only depicting the Americans view of the events of the Boston Massacre.  Revere is trying to make the British seem like they are a lot worse than they really are even thought they were just retaliating to the violence directed towards them.<br />
I do not really agree that the British commander is sitting in the side lines and not doing any work himself.  That is the way the British military operates, the commanders job is to give firing orders so that the soldiers cut down their enemies more efficiently.  When in formation it is not the commanders job to pick up a rifle and start firing at the enemy.</p>

			<p>This was the best post of the three. I absolutely agree with you that paintings and images give insight into the thoughts and feelings of people, rather than what actually happened. It is important to remember that paintings are not always meant to portray literal meaning, in which the artist uses symbolism. I think you did a good job looking for things of this nature such as how the setting was in front of a church and at night. Before reading your post I had not noticed that the sky is day over the Americans, which Revere probably intentionally did to emphasize that they are the good guys. Also, I found it interesting that you discussed Revere’s personal motivations and how he might have used this painting at a way to gain support for independence. This gave support to your thesis and is a reason why images are more useful in understanding thoughts and feelings than understanding what actually happened. </p>
<p>It is hard to say how you could have improved your post, in that you covered everything I would have and more. One thing is that you should have had a conclusion and introduction that is separate from your supportive material. Also, you could have gone on Wikipedia and explained what really happened at the Boston Massacre. By doing so you could have supported the fact that Revere’s depiction was biased for the purpose of gaining support for the revolution. Otherwise, your blog post was interesting and very insightful.</p>

			<p>I liked how you seemed to describe more to me about what the artist was trying to do with the picture. Not saying that the other ones didn&#8217;t, I just seemed to get more from your post. You made good points about what the Revere was trying to do. With certain images in the picture you made good reference by what was trying to be pointed out. I like how you pointed out that the revolutionary leaders would try to be creative to support their cause. This was a good point made because anything that could be done to help their cause they would do and this picture is a perfect example of it.</p>
<p>The problem that I have with this post is that it has no structure with and introduction, body, and conclusion. Its just kind of all combined together with your facts. I think you have to much information in your opening paragraph, that you repeat some in the second paragraph. Some of the same facts are said again that shouldn&#8217;t be or should be supported more. Otherwise good read.</p>

			<p>Your post was very well written because it was short and to the point without the extra unnecessary information. I like that you had a good amount of facts to backup your claim about the painting. I agree with you that the paintings give an idea of how the people were feeling and what they were thinking, instead of the actual truth of the matter.</p>
<p>The only downside I thought was the lack of a solid frame. I mean the post was kind of jumbled together, not properly arranged with the introduction and stuff. It was also a bit redundant in some areas of the beginning.</p>

			<p>Yes this picture does show that the British are fighting the Americans unjustly. The Americans are unarmed and did not instigate. Actually it all happened on accident. A shot was fired when a British soldier fell, so then all of the British started firing. I wonder why the Captain did not hault the fire. Also, I fully agree with you that in the picture it looks like Captain Preston is hiding behind his own men. He does not want to fight against unarmed people. I think this to be a picture of a coward.<br />
The Americans outnumber the British two to one so why are the Americans not fighting back though? Perhaps they are begging for mercy since they are not at fault or armed. I fully agree that this scene depicts the British as evil. Revere did a lot of rearranging in order to depict the British in this manner. He put &#8220;Butcher&#8217;s House&#8221; on the building instead of &#8220;Custom House,&#8221; he puts the massacre in front of a church, and shows the Americans helping those who have been shot while still get fired upon instead of retaliating.<br />
But looking at the facts, it was all a misunderstanding. </p>
<p>Your argument to support your thesis appeared at the end of your blog. You should have put more details on this. You also seemed to repeat yourself. For example&#8230;mentioning the switch of &#8220;butchers house&#8221; twice. Other than that, it was straight to the point and something one can agree with.</p>

			<p>Your post really went in depth with all the details in the painting and it was interesting to go back to the painting and find them. I think that paintings have much deeper meanings then just the picture drawn. This picture ties in everything that was going on without drawing a picture for each. There is very little that I can say to improve your post I think it was very clear and informative. The only thing that I noticed was that you didn’t have a very clear conclusion. If you just made it a little clearer, your post would be perfect.</p>

			<p>Your post is similar to AJ&#8217;s, and I like the way that you address the massacre as being biased. All accusations that are being made against the British ring true, although we can never really know for sure. But Revere seems to have done his job correctly, seeing as the Americans really do seem to be picked on by the British soldiers</p>

			<p>Well writting blog post, straight and to the point.  I liked the fact that Revere changed the name of the building to &#8220;Buthers House&#8221; to show that the Americans are being butchered.  Revere held nothing back to paint a bad image of the British.  From unarmed Americans to blood spewing out of one Americans head that is laying lifeless on the ground.  You also mentioned that the massacre was in front of a church, none of the other posts pointed that fact out.  As for the British commander not being in the fight, only giving orders, officers in the military rarely get into firefights unless they are in the thick of it.  They are usually the ones that are in the base thinking of ways to win.  I do not think that an officer was necessary for this massacre, but since Revere included him in the picture and the way that he is depicted show that the British did not care.<br />
Your thesis statement was very well written as well.  You chose one aspect, the history of an event through the point of view of someone who actually lived it, and contintued to write about it.</p>

			<p>Just looking at the picture itself does seem that the British are evil and cruel. Obviously the Americans do not look like they are fighting back and are defending themselves. Although it seems that the British are evil, we do not know for sure that the word “slaughter house” is meant for the Americans. As we know, back in the days they did have places where they would chop up raw meat to sell. And that cloud of smoke surrounding the British troops is ridiculous because the Americans are not even trying to fight back. Instead, they look helpless.</p>
<p>The information in this post was straight forward and easy to follow. Again, there is no right or wrong answer and you put every detail that you believed in on your post. I couldn’t have explained the picture more clearly the way you did. The way that Paul Revere drew the picture made us look at the small details hidden behind the main big cloud and buildings. The small details are what explain the irony of this picture. I do agree that this picture was meant to show the public that the British are not as kind as they are.</p>

			<p>Your blog is very informative and interesting to me. I liked the way you interpret the paint by giving good details. I agree with you that the picture shows only one side point of view portrayed  the British as evil. I liked that you said the Boston Massacre supported colonist and led t0 the revolution. I also liked that you point out that changing the name of building suggests the British butchered the Americans.<br />
Overall, your blog is clear and well organized. Your writing is straight forward to answer the questions and following instruction very well. But, I think your paper would be even better if you have a separate conclusion over viewing all your point. Also, you talked about the name of building twice repeating yourself. Other than that, your writing was very good, and I enjoyed reading it.</p>

			<p>It was really interesting the way you explained the picture. I looked at it after reading it and agree completely on what you had to say about it and the reasons Paul Revere painted it. If I had been around during this time I probably would have gone to the Americans side if I wasn’t already on it. This painting probably was very useful propaganda for the colonial side. It really makes the British seem big and bad. I think you described the painting really well and talked about things it had that I probably never would have thought of.</p>

			<p>I really like how you brought out the fact that a sign of a building was changed to &#8220;butcher house&#8221;. This proves without a doubt that this was a piece made to sway public opinion, by throwing in that little subliminal word choice. I think your thesis was very well thought out, and nicely concluded at the end. I am also greatful that you did not call the civilians American troops. I agree that looking at one source for an event will inevitably give one a biased perspective on that event since as you said, many people exaggerate stories.</p>

			<p>This is another very blog.  The thesis is short and to the point and the evidence provided is very supportive.  I also like how the author goes into to hypothesize why Revere may have wanted to portray the British as he did.  I think it is safe to say that Revere’s portrayal struck a far more damaging blow to the British then did the Boston Massacre to the American’s.  The effects of propaganda like this I believe are often overlooked throughout history.  This is not to say that this picture was responsible for the American Revolution, but the effects of the media were as important then as they are now, possibly more important since there were less outputs.  Thus I submit that this picture is no more part of history than tomarrow’s front page of the Washington Post, however it is the reaction of the people this picture that made history.<br />
As for criticism of this blog I have none, it is written well and its thesis is proven by the end of the blog.</p>

			<p>This essay is extremly similar to something I would have written if this had been my assignment. I felt that the picture was analyzed extremly well. The essay not only gave the fact that the Americans were not retaliating, it explained what the sign read, the crowd sizes as well as the fact that this was happening in front of a Church at night. This puts a very clear image in my mind that the creator of this picture wanted the British to be viewed very poorly. In this time period it of course would have been frowned upon to shoot an innocent man, but to do this in front of a Church, just plain evil. This in a way could relate to the scene from &#8220;The Patriot&#8221; watched in class when the people were in the Church and it was burned down. Possibly these two works are great exaples of how biases exist.</p>

			<p>You presented your ideas and arguments for Paul Revers&#8217;s depiction of the Boston massacre very well. By changing many of the details in the picture, such as the location and the butchers sign, revere effectively demonstrated his point. I think that you included every detail about this picture that would help your point. Also, I think grammatically you presented your argument very eloquently.</p>

			<p>All the ideas and descriptions stated in your post was very insightful and helped me intepret the picture even better.  After looking at the picture multiple times, I didn&#8217;t once think to myself why Paul Revere drew this picture or the relevance of it.  All I thought about was the actual picture itself and the things happening in the picture.  Now after reading your blog and looking at the picture, I can agree with you when you say how this picture is used to depict the British as being evil and maybe it even helped gain support of the colonists for the revolution.  He defiantly wanted us to know that and the picture defiantly resembles it.</p>
<p>Its hard to give a critique on an assigment like this because there is no right or wrong answer, but I would say that I didn&#8217;t like how you only used two paragraphs for this essay.  Only having two paragraphs makes it very hard for the reader to understand what the introduction, body, and conclusion are.  I know I was very confused.  Next time you right an essay just put it into three or more paragraphs and that will help the reader understand it more.</p>

			<p>Your post does a very good job of covering the major points made in the picture. You tie the time, location, participants and situation into your argument well and you include information about the relevant historical period to lend weight to your analysis. I am convinced by your assessment of Paul Revere&#8217;s motive.</p>
<p>Critically, the only suggestion I could offer is that if the post were to be longer, you could include details of the individual people in the picture.  For example, the colonists are aiding one of their injured. The expressions on the faces of the British soldiers appear to be ones of glee.  One of the colonists has a hand up in the &#8220;stop&#8221; gesture, perhaps to try to reason with the British.  All seem to convey messages about the character of each side in general, through Revere&#8217;s eyes.</p>

			<p>I really enjoy read your blog, because this is very good bolg. Your pick one particular person and talk about his views. I really think you analyzed picture well, also add some thought by your own. After reading your blog, I think the British shoot unarmed American was totally wrong. Even American was unarmed, but they still try fight back.  That showed me, they really want to spare from British and they want to have their own life in America.<br />
There was something missing in your writing. Something that can bring to your blog into high level, so people can really understand deeply. If you can write little more , and add more thought and what you thinking into your blog. That will be great. Over all this is very good writing, I really enjoy read your blog.</p>

			<p>I really liked how you said that Revere may have used this to gain support from fellow Americans to fight against the British.  What better way to rally people than to show their own people being killed for no apparent reason?  You did a good job discussing the elements in the picture.  You talked about how Revere changed the name of the building behind the British troops quite a bit and i feel that that element of the picture is definately the most powerful.  Upon seeing this picture, I would expect that most Americans probably already thought that the British were murderers, but doing this action in front of a sign that said Butcher&#8217;s House reinforces that thought even more.  Good blog!</p>

			<p>After reading your blog post, I must say that it is very insightful and intersting. Showing Americans being murdered at the hands of the British, shows us the British as evil people.  We see the the British as a evil empire killing innocent Americans. Good example describing the Americans out numbering the British, however not choosing to fight back. I really enjoyed reading your blog. Nice job describing the picture as well as supporting evidence. Great job.</p>

			<p>I thought your post was very straightforward. I thought your interpretations were interesting. You explained your interpretation of the picture very clearly, no confusions. By looking at the picture you know that the artist of the picture wanted Americans to feel a certain way towards the British people. If the British people were to make a picture or ad it would definitely be quite different from this one. It would show a different aspect.<br />
Overall I think your post was interesting. The one thing I would suggest would have been adding another paragraph for your conclusion besides that it was good post.</p>

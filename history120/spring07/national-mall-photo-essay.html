				<p>Though all of the memorials at the National Mall are built in their own, very special and different way, there are themes that can tie each monument together. <strong>At the World War II Memorial, the George Washington Monument, and the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, each monument had a completely different look, but one idea tied them all together: the idea of how atmosphere and water play into one&#8217;s overall experience at the memorials</strong>. All three monuments had very different atmospheres and the mood surrounding the memorials was varried from each memorial. Not only did the way the memorials were built effect this overall atmosphere, but the way people acted around each of the monuments, as well as the role that water played at the monument, effected the experience one would have when visiting the National Mall. </p>
<p>The first memorial I visited was the World War II Memorial. Just by walking up from where I parked my car, I could see how great the memorial is just by its pure size. It is huge! However, most people did not seemd fazed by how large this memorial was, but seemed to flock near to where the numorous water features were. When you approach the memorial, you can hear the roaring of water fountains from a good distance away. This made the already bustling atmosphere (due to the large groups of people standing everywhere) even more chaotic by adding this loud sound of water. People did not seem to want to stop their conversations to take a look around and pay attention to the massive amounts of detail that were clearly put into this memorial, for example, the name of every state being engraved into a smaller pillar surrounding the memorial itself. The overall lighthearted feeling could have been due to the gorgeous weather on this particular day, but I do not think so. If one looked closely at the fountains, you could see that thousands of pennies had been thrown into the water over the years. The idea of throwing a penny into the water symbolizes making a wish, a task people usually take on when they are in a happy, more spirited mood, which could only be contributed to by the atmosphere at the World War II Memorial.</p>
<p>The second memorial I visited was the George Washington Monument, with its Reflecting Pool. The atmosphere here starkly contrasted the overall feeling one gathered from the World War II Memorial. Although there were large, loud crowds of people standing near the streets and behind the relecting pool, there were few people standing right next the the reflecting pool, and the ones that were, did not seem to make much noise. The water involved in this memorial was also very different to that of the first memorial I visited. There were no flowing fountains creating noise, in fact, there was no extravegance at all, only a long, rectangular, still pool of water. One thing that really struck me about this memorial was the Reflecting Pool itself. When you stand completely centered across from the monument itself, you see its entire reflection in the pool, and it honestly is quite a site. It makes this already huge monument seem twice as tall. I do not know if people were shy due to the pure height of the monument, or if the still water had a calming effect on the people at the memorial there that day, but the atmosphere was much more quiet and subdued than the first memorial I visited.</p>
<p>The third and final memorial I visited was the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial. This memorial was by far the quietest regarding people making noise, but was also the loudest in terms of water. As soon as you walk into the memorial, you see the first waterfall of many. Although by itself it is a rather demure waterfall, combind with the other waterfalls, the overall effect is a great one. This memorial is also built very differently than the others, in that it is more of a maze shape, and you more proactive in experiencing the memorial, much more so than the George Washington Monument, or the World War II Memorial for that matter. Most of the engravings on the walls and the waterfalls themselves are on almost the same level as you are, making the experience much more intimate. There were few people evn walking around the FDR Memorial that day, which makes me question whether or not I got an accurate feel on what people act like at this memorial, but from what I was able to observe, people were very quiet, barely speaking to eachother. There is a picture in my photo essay of several statue men standing in a row, that at the time I did not realize represented people during the Great Depression, but once I researched it more, it all seemed to make sense. Their glum faces and shabby clothing were very symbolic of the times during the period that FDR was president. The waterfalls also seemed to capture the idea of that time as well, in their small and understated stature, there was nothing overly flashy or intimidating about this memorial, but much more like something people can actually relate to. </p>
<p>Overall, my experience at the National Mall was an excellent one. I had never really been there for a school project, and clearly needing to pay attention to small details made the experience that much different. I had never really stopped to think about the atmosphere surround the memorials before, including that of how people were acting in certain areas, or the role that water played in each of the memorials. I chose these specific memorials because they all used water in their overall design, and I wanted to see how that effected the mood that surround the memorial. As a general rule, I observed that when the water was avtive and loud, so were the people, and visa versa. The way people acted coincided with the way the water behaved more so than I had ever noticed before, and it truly did bring an entire new perspective to the National Mall.</p>

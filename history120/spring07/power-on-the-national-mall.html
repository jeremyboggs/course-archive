				<p>A monument is something erected in memory of a person, event, etc., such as a building, pillar, or statue. The National Mall in Washington D.C. is a convenient location for everyone to enjoy many monuments dedicated to people, presidents, wars, and soldiers, and is a nice environment to relax and to reflect. Each memorial is different and has different “rules,” themes, feelings, thoughts, and presence. For example, the rushing fountains of the World War II memorial have a very different atmosphere than the secluded garden of the World War I memorial. However the goal of all the memorials is the same, to show honor and respect to the object it is remembering. <strong>The </strong><strong>Lincoln</strong><strong> Memorial, </strong><strong>Washington</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Monument</strong><strong>, and Thomas Jefferson Memorial commemorate presidential legacies, depicting the men as the greatness they were through size and the atmosphere in which they are surrounded. </strong>Although they are all simple statues they all portray the men they represent in a powerful way.<br />
 </p>
<p>The Washington Monument is the most prominent, and one of the oldest memorials in Washington D.C., as well as the tallest building in the entire city. Completed in 1885, the Washington Monument stands erect in the West end of the National Mall at 555 feet. The structure is overwhelming in size and it is extremely hard to take in the entire view in a simple gaze. The Washington Monument was built in honor of George Washington, who led our country to independence and was later our nation’s first president. At the base of the monument are fifty flags, representing the fifty states. I find this to be odd since when Washington was president, there were not fifty states. Perhaps the flags show what an accomplishment his nation has become and how it has flourished. Washington achieved much greatness as a single man, and in honor of him, a single astonishing structure is placed in his honor. The monument is too much to take in at one glance, and there is more to acknowledge about George Washington in a single thought. The Washington Monument seems to tower over everything, and in fact it is still the tallest building in the District of Columbia. There is a rumor that a law states that nothing is allowed to be created taller than the Washington Monument, however, I discovered that the law states that a building’s height cannot be made more than 20 feet greater than the width of the adjacent street. I enjoyed the thought that no building was allowed to be taller, it put more power into the Washington Monument. There is much more though that makes this monument powerful. There Washington Monument can be seen from thirty to forty miles (on a clear day). That means that even outside of Washington D.C. one can remember our first president. No other memorial on the Mall is like that. In fact most require you to actually be up close and in the memorial to really see all that it has to offer.<br />
 </p>
<p>Both the Thomas Jefferson Memorial and the Lincoln Memorial, require you to be inside the structure in order to take in the awe of the memorial. Even though the Lincoln Memorial building can be seen from the Washington Monument, it is mysterious and pulls you to walk the distance to see what it is. Once inside the columns you are blown away by the enormous statue of Abraham Lincoln hidden from the outside. The statue is nineteen feet tall and is very intimidating, however inspiring. Lincoln is depicted sitting down and has a serious look on his face that demands respect from onlookers. One hand is clenched and the other is open. Could this be showing the strong, forceful side of Lincoln on one hand and the calm fatherly side of him on the other. Above the sixteenth president is the dedication, “IN THIS TEMPLE AS IN THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM HE SAVED THE UNION THE MEMORY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN IS ENSHRINED FOREVER.” These words are visible over Lincoln’s head, however they do come secondary to the main highlight of the memorial, Lincoln. The exhibit’s atmosphere is quiet and respectful. Whenever I think of Abraham Lincoln, I think of the phrase “honest Abe” and when I was in the memorial, I remembered that and was very respectful and just took in all of the surroundings. On the south wall is Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address is inscribed and Lincoln&#8217;s second inaugural address is inscribed on the north wall. It is nice to be able to read the powerful words spoken by Lincoln in his presence. The exterior of the Lincoln Memorial is more relaxed and there are steps where one can relax and gather your thoughts as you gaze at the reflecting pool. Lincoln was known as the Great Emancipator and preserver of the nation during the Civil War. Being at the end of the reflecting pool and sitting in both its presence and Lincoln’s allows for one to think about those events and the fact that without this man and his work, the world would be a different place.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Jefferson Memorial has a little bit of a different vibe. The Lincoln Memorial is complemented by the reflecting pool, and the Jefferson Memorial is complemented by the Cherry Blossom Trees, however only visible in March and April. The Cherry Blossoms are celebrated with a festival announcing their arrival, and Thomas Jefferson is celebrated with his work on the Declaration of Independence, which is celebrated with many Fourth of July festivals. The exterior feeling of the Jefferson Memorial is that of a celebration, but the interior of the Jefferson Memorial is peaceful and respectful.<br />
The Jefferson Memorial is located in West Potomac Park on the shore of the Tidal Basin of the Potomac River, across the street and part of the river from the other monuments. Like the Lincoln Memorial the main component of the Jefferson Memorial is hidden in the shadows until one steps foot inside the columns. Once inside, you are greeted by a nineteen foot, ten thousand pound, bronze statue of the third president, Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson is depicted standing tall and proud. Under the stature is a sentence taken out of one of Jefferson’s letters, &#8220;I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.&#8221; This phrase fills one with pride for our country and gives you the feeling of triumph, freedom, and everything our country stands for. I associate this feeling with the same feeling you get on the fourth of July. Also located in the Jefferson Memorial is an excerpt from the Declaration of Independence, for which Jefferson was known for drafting.<br />
 </p>
<p>Even though each of these memorials are different, they are also very alike in which they honor the men for which they stand. The Washington Monument is a single structure with more power than a thousand little structures. The Washington Monument will forever be known for its records and everything will appear tiny in comparison, and Washington will forever be known for his achievements and all presidents compared to our first. The Lincoln Memorial commemorates a man known for changing the world and also gives you a chance to sit and reflect on this. One is intimidated by the size and look on his face and can not help but be respectful in his presence. The Jefferson Memorial calls for respect and patriarchy, and even though one feels respect, you also cannot help but be proud and feel free. It is hard to believe what power and emotion can come from stone.   </p>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>Women have always been characterized and looked at differently by society as time has passed on through the years. From the way women are looked at in the kitchen and household, how women are looked at by men and their relationships with them, and to how women think about things they buy like an automobile. <strong>Over the time from the 50&#8217;s to present day today, some things have not changed, but a lot of the ways we viewed women today have changed since then.</strong></p>
<p>The movie that I looked at from youtube is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dOviPRMoyQ">Cooking Terms</a> video. I thought that this movie degraded women and made them look like they had no intelligence and could not figure out the basic thing associated with cooking. In the beginning of the movie it shows Margie not being able to figure out the basics of creaming the butter and putting cream into the batter instead of creaming the butter and it messed up her cake. In todays society women are not looked at like that. However, most of the time women are the ones associated with cooking, but in the society today, they are looked at as intelligent individuals and not just a woman who can not figure out the basic things in a cookbook. We do not think of them not being able to follow directions. Another thing is it shows Margie&#8217;s husband going off to work and her staying home with nothing to do, but to cook for her newlywed husband of hers. This is really typical of life in the 50&#8217;s and what was expected of women, to stay home and take care of the house and cook for her husband. Today even though some women are housewives there are also plenty of working woman that do not stay home and have educated jobs. Back in the 50&#8217;s that was very rare to find, a woman working and not staying home. So that is something that has changed. Even though most of the woman that work do come home and make dinner, it is not unusual for a guy to make dinner like it was back then. The other thing that I noticed was how Margie served her husband, like she was his servant. She cut the cake then served him first and then herself. Today women are not expected to serve their husband. Men are expected to be able to get their own food for themselves and not be waited on.<br />
Today the way women are viewed has changed significantly since the 50&#8217;s. In this clip I found of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzEh-3sqiK4">30 minute meals</a>(which is very bad recording and very bad clip by someone with nothing to do) it is proving how things have changed over time. Yes, it is still portraying women in the kitchen, but the show is to show how to make a dinner in 30 minutes or less. This is showing that women are not staying home and that they are out working and do not always have the time to make dinner and this is an easy way to do it. In the video from the 50&#8217;s all the things that were made were time consuming because all the women in the 50&#8217;s were portrayed to have all the time during the day. This is not the cause today because women are working and are not expected to stay at home and cook and clean.</p>
<p>There is another show from today, Food 911 on the food network and its hosted by Tyler Florence. I could not find a clip to show of it, but it is a how to show on cooking. It shows how to make certain foods that people have trouble with. This proves how times has changed because it is hosted by a guy. Back in the 50&#8217;s it would be pretty rare to see a cooking show hosted by a guy, or being portrayed doing a job that back then was thought of as a job that was suppose to be done by a woman. Its proving that women are not looked at as they need to be the ones in the kitchen making dinner in todays societ, that guys are capable of being in a kitchen too. I think it is putting women on an equal level with men, like they should be.</p>
<p>Even though women are still looked at today by some people not equal to men, it is no where close to how it was in the 50&#8217;s. Things have changed over that time span and women are looked at as very intelligent individuals today, not so much then. So even though some people think that women have not made a big movement and are still looked at as lesser individuals by some, it is by far no where close to how they were looked at and thought of back then.</p>

			<p>You are making a point, I&#8217;ll give you that much. But I could interpret your sources on modern day cooking differently. (I&#8217;m not saying anything is wrong, this is just my interpretation of what these shows are saying to me)</p>
<p>With 30 minute meals, it could portray that now, because women wanted jobs, they have to find ways to do what they are supposed to do in less time. So on top of a job, they have to be the cook, the maid, and the babysitter (or find one) while the man still only works and watches football. The example doesn&#8217;t really show that the women aren&#8217;t needed in the kitchen, it&#8217;s just that they have to be more efficient now.<br />
I have a clip from &#8220;Malcolm in the Middle&#8221; that kinda characterizes this. (it&#8217;s a slice of a whole episode, the clip I&#8217;m talking about starts at 4 minutes and 18 seconds into the clip)<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Cp-iykgrA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9Cp-iykgrA</a><br />
The mother of the show (Lois) is at a book club, and they all get drunk and start talking (complaining) about their lives, stating that at least back in the 50&#8217;s you could choose between housewife, working life, etc. but the wife has to do it all now.</p>
<p>In Food 911, if I really wanted to read deep into this (which I will) since the show is about helping people with food, and because it is hosted by a guy, it could mean that if women can&#8217;t get it right, the man will have to fix it. But without a real clip, I can&#8217;t really prove that statement.</p>
<p>I just think that society is still a little aways from achieving true equality.</p>

			<p>Well written post that states a very strong argument.  It seems that the majority of the bloggers have chosen the &#8220;Cooking Terms&#8221; video to critique.  But this is the first post that counters the video with another cooking video.  Both arguments brought up, about how women only need 30 minutes to cook a meal after a long, hard day at work, and about how men host cooking shows now.  This is completely different from how the cooking in the household was taken care of in the 1950&#8217;s.  There are now a lot a male cooks who host their own shows, from Wolfgang Puck to Emeril, the &#8220;BAM!&#8221; guy.  The only critique that I have is in the thesis statement.  It kind of contradicts itself with things not changing but some things have.  I do not think that you needed to add the &#8220;some things have not changed.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I thought this was an interesting post.  Once again the &#8220;cooking time&#8221; video does a really good job of showing how women were portrayed in the 1950&#8217;s.  I thought the modern examples were a little weak.  The 30minute meals clip though in no way degrading still shows a women in a rush trying to cook for her hubby.  Also men have always been cheifs so it would have been of no suprise to me if in the 50&#8217;s there was a cooking show with a male host.</p>

			<p>I liked your example proving that it is now usual for men to cook for themselves.  This puts to our attention the stereotype of women being housewives and taking care of food or cleaning the house.  I agree that society&#8217;s perceptions of women have changed since the 1950s.  However, I still feel that women are still looked upon inferiorly, not yet as an equal to men. </p>
<p>Your blog was a good read.  However, your first supporting paragraph had so much information in it.  It would have been better if you separated it into two so that your thoughts would be clearer.  You also would not have jumped from one statement to the next.  You begin your paragraph about a video on youtube, and then talk about women in the 1950s.  There needed to be a transition or a separate sentence to introduce a new example.  Overall I enjoyed reading your post!</p>

			<p>Your post was good. You included a lot of new ideas that I had never even thought about. I liked your exampels such as Thirty minute Meals and Food 911. I had never thought about the fact that that helps show how women have become less of hosuewives now. That is a very interesting point and I liked that. I agree with you, but I still think that women are viewed as the house wife. </p>
<p>Godd points, good examples and I liked it. You did a good job explaining what you were talking about and it made it easy to follow along. I think that maybe you could have not explained the movie so much in detail, because you did have a link to it. Other than that, I thought it was a good post! Enjoyed it!</p>

			<p>I think you could benefit from re-wording your thesis, the main idea of it is good, but its not easy on the eyes. All in all I thought your post was good, I don&#8217;t know that I necessarily agree with your views on the image portrayed, or possibly portrayed, by 30 minute meals and food 911 but I can definately see where you are coming from, you did make your points clear and I did enjoy reading your post.</p>

			<p>I completely agree with your post. Instead of saying that a woman&#8217;s role has changed completely it is better to say that yes she still does those things, but she also does a lot of other things as well.<br />
That clip &#8220;cooking terms&#8221; is a great clip to show how a wife was expected to be back then. At home, in the kitchen, cooking, dressed attractively but conservatively, complete with an apron. Today woman are expected to still look nice, perhaps not so conservatively since today is so sexual, but they can and are encouraged strongly to get a high education, have a well paying job, and still cook, and take care of the kids. Husbands are a expected these days to take on a little more responcibility, like serve themselves and help out around the house. Women need shows like food 911 because they are expected to still be able to cook for the family. It is a good point to say that the show is hosted by a guy since cooking was considered a woman&#8217;s job back then, but it also shows that men can take on the cooking duties too.<br />
Your post is realistic and shows the world as it is today. The only flaw I found was that your thesis was not strong and a bit wordy. It&#8217;s just kind of a sentence you bolded.<br />
Overall your post was interesting and one I can completey agree with because it is so realistic.</p>

			<p>Your post was pretty good over all.  The cooking terms video does a good job of showing what society thought of women in the 1950&#8217;s.  Clearly society was male dominated during that time period and it did not give women an ounce of credit regarding their intelligence.  The second video you used of 30 minute meals shows how societies views of women have changed.  This show makes the assumption that women no longer have the whole day to spend in the kitchen and they need to be able to make meals quickly.</p>

			<p>Once again another person used the &#8220;cooking term&#8221; video. Its a good video because it sums up the view of a lady back in the day. Yes times have changed and yes women have come a long way. Back then a woman was expected to cook whether she knew how to or not but now a days if a woman was only good at cooking then she could make a living out of it. When job positions are open these days they dont specify the job to be to a person of a certain sex but whoever fulfills the requirements needed. But no matter how far we have come today from back then, it is usually the lady of the house that is expected to do the cooking and most of the house chores even if she does get some help from her husband.</p>

			<p>Also notice how we keep saying wife and husband, they could just be a couple in a relationship that live together even though they aren&#8217;t married. We see more of that now a days then we did back then. So this goes to people who are living with their spouse/significant other.</p>

			<p>Your post is really interesting, and I enjoyed reading it. I totally agree with everything you said in the post, women’s roles in society have changed a lot since the 1950s. Your interpretation about the two video was interesting. I really liked the way you gave some specific examples showing how women’s roles has changed. “Cooking term” did really good job to support your idea, and I liked that you compared how today’s women are different from 50’s. Also, I was interested in your comment on Food 911 because I had not really recognized it shows today’s women become less of responsible for cooking than 50s. I think it is a good point.<br />
I actually did not get what “30minute meals” were trying to say until your interpretation. Your interpretation is understandable, but this video clip is a little bit weak to support your idea. Other than that, your post was really great. Also, it would be even better if you split your second paragraph as two.</p>

			<p>Good post! What I like about this post is that this author clearly proves their thesis by provided information to support it such as “working woman that do not stay home and have educated jobs. Back in the 50’s that was very rare to find”. The roles that women have taken in the past have changed dramatically and are something that you would not see if you were living in the 1950’s. What I didn’t like about this post is that some of the sentences was a little off which made it a little hard to understand. The post author did somewhat support their thesis adequately.</p>

			<p>I liked your post. Women&#8217;s roles have changed dramatically and alot of women have two jobs, one in the world and one at home. The cooking terms video did a good job portraying the average housewife in the 50&#8217;s. Nowadays their are many different situations with husbands staying at home and being the &#8220;housedad&#8221;. Basically in modern times anyhting is possible and women are definitley more independent than ever before. You had some good arguments that supported your thesis.</p>

			<p>I agree with you that women have come a long way since the 50&#8217;s, and are continuing to grow as individuals. In fact, women have come a long way in the past ten years. Todays women not only cooks, cleans and vaccums, but she also works a full time job. She has become superwomen. Its important to understand that a women that decides to sit at home to cook and clean (along with doing other sterotypical things) is not less then any other women. That was a decision she had made and as an educated society we should respect that decision.</p>

			<p>You did a good job of picking out the subtler things in the &#8216;Cooking Time!&#8217; video.  From the incompetence with which she is portrayed to the servitude evident (i.e. she serves Tim even though she was ALSO the one who cooked the meal).</p>
<p>Your second paragraph seems like it should be split into at least two paragraphs, as it talks about two different videos.</p>

			<p>I really enjoyed read your post, I like how to use example to support you thesis. And I agree with your idea. I think women have change a lot in 1950. They were not just housewives and taking care of food and kids. I think now in those day men cook more than women least in house. My dad cooks more than my mother. However, women still are view as the house wife. I think you really explained your post well, it’s really easy for reader understand what you tired to say. I think this is very good post, well done and I really enjoyed read you post.</p>

			<p>I liked how you acknowledged that many things have not changed since the fifties regarding women’s roles, because if you didn’t, I think your argument would have been extremely far-fetched and hard to believe. I found the 30 Minute Meals clip very appropriate for your post, because it can be compared and contrasted with the Cooking Terms video. Women in general are still usually the ones expected to cook dinner for the family, but it is now understood that they have busy lives too and don’t necessarily have the time to cook all day. </p>
<p>I also found interesting your discussion about males being in the kitchen is becoming a more common occurrence. This is true, but I believe that a better clip could have been used to show this because males have always been head chefs, like the one in Food 911. A better clip would have been one that showed males in the kitchen of a household, because all of your arguments were about females in the household kitchen, not TV shows. Also, I think that your thesis statement would have been better if you mentioned the role of women in household kitchens, because that is what your post was about. Overall, though, I think your post was well structured and had good supporting evidence.</p>

			<p>I like how you brought another view other than women were just expected to stay home. In the cooking terms video, the woman was not even able to follow directions. She had problems cooking and even looked somewhat ditzy and hopeless without a man to show her the way.<br />
It was kind of hard to follow you on your first paragraph. I think that you may have had so much to say that it just got a little mixed up. As far as the second video of the woman cooking, it was a little hard to follow, especially with that music in the background.</p>

			<p>I agree with your thesis about things not changing over time, but I think that you should have said something about women in the kitchen in since you talk so much about it throughtout the post. I think you did do a great job at making your point about some things not changing since the 50&#8217;s.</p>

			<p>I understand your point, however I think that you could have used better examples to portray your message. I also think that your thesis should have been a little clearer. I think it was somewhat vague. However, your post was informative and interesting. To improve it I think that you would just need to focus on the syntax and examples a little more.</p>

			<p>Good comparison. It is definiteley apparent in todays television commercials for everything from Boston Market to KFC that women are on the move and they do not necessairly have time to gruel over the stove to make a meal. Lives have become busier busier with the passing of time. Back in the 50&#8217;s it would have probably been unheard of for a woman to go out and do things like yoga instead of being at home cooking. Your post was good and it pointed out some good examples. I think you could probably be more concise with your thesis though and zero in on your supporting topics.</p>

			<p>This was a very interesting post.  I really learned a lot of new material that I had not known before.  I really enjoyed your topic of how women have come a long way since the 50&#8217;s.  This topic can include a lot of things, but you broke it down into a couple examples and explained them very well.  These examples did a really good job of proving your argument that women have come a long way.  The &#8220;cooking terms&#8221; video did an exceptional job of explaining why women are growing and growing everyday.</p>
<p>I thought you second paragraph was a bit to long.  It seemed like you were rambling words at the end.  Maybe next time just break it into two paragraphs so its easier to read.  Good job though.</p>

			<p>I enjoyed reading your post. Your examples were very good, and your supporting arguments were on the money. Showing how women are much more independent compared to women in the passed was a good comparison. Overall your blog was very interesting and  informing. Great job</p>

			<p>I think you did a great job on your post, I didn’t really find anything that I would have changed. I really enjoyed how you touched on every subject and didn’t only cover one thing. I also liked how you emphasized that now on the cooking channels there are men teaching the cooking and not really woman. I think its ironic that men are better at “womanly” duties such as cooking, designing clothing, and furniture. Most of the more successful people are always men.</p>

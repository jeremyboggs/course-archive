			<div class="entry">
				<p>          “Cold Mountain” takes place during the Civil War in North Carolina when the men living in this area are rushed to join the Confederate Army.  This movie portrays Ada’s, a woman who falls in love with Inman, perspective on the war while waiting for her love’s return.  She continues writing letters to him while he is fighting, but he doesn’t respond back to her.  <strong>Hence, “Cold Mountain” shows a historical sense and makes viewers sympathize for Inman by portraying his heroism, and by showing a struggling love story as he is separated from Ada.<br />
</strong>          I feel this movie does not necessarily show which army is the good or bad side.  Although it shows Inman’s heroism, he does not account for the rest of the Confederate army.  Like the previous example, people in the same army found quarrels amongst themselves finding traitors instead of helping each other.  For example, in a particular scene when one of the men who escaped was found, they killed the man’s family and tormented his mom by tying her hands onto a log and stomping on it.  This scene also signifies a historical sense of how people in the same confederate sides could go against each other, so it was hard to trust anyone.  To make us sympathize, there are many brutal clips of innocent men crying in agonizing pain when wounded.  Their rivals in the Union army are not completely shown as horrible people.  In a particular scene when Inman is searching for shelter he is welcomed by a mother who provides him with hospitality.  When the Union army came into the home looking for food, one of the men in the troop raped the mother, but the other man tried to help the baby from being cold. Thus, there is no right or good side portrayed in this movie.  All the people during this time in the Civil War were just struggling to survive, struggling to return back to their families, struggling because of hunger; they were all in the same circumstance.  Traitors were most likely caught and dawned with revenge.<br />
             One of the ways this movie illustrates a historical interpretation is by interpreting the word “masculinity” without agreeing to society’s perspective of men.  In order for men to be “masculine” in society today, the media portrays that men should not be shown vulnerable; they should not show their emotions publicly or they are considered weak.  Inman shows that he is courageous in another way.  He shows emotion and pain when he risks his life trying to save two of his fellow companions fighting in the war.  He gets shot once when he tries to save his friend who had already died.  In this way, Inman is illustrated as a caretaker who is compassionate for others. He is also shown vulnerable when he is alone, homeless and hungry escaping from the war.  He begs for shelter, depicting the role of manhood society stresses.<br />
             Because “Cold Mountain” also illustrates a love story, this movie helps viewers to side with Inman’s survival so that he could return to Ada.  A significant scene is when Ada’s father dies in the rain, and she is left by herself.  Ada’s image changes as very frail and extremely thin.  Her hair isn’t as neatly braided; she is easily frightened, and isolates herself in her house.  There is one scene showing Ada eating like a homeless person that starved many days as she hurriedly gulps the soup her friend made.  Showing this drastic character change in Ada makes viewers hope for Inman’s return back home so that she wouldn’t loose everyone important to her.   <br />
          In conclusion, “Cold Mountain” portrays the time of the Civil War in a historical and realistic sense.  The movie doesn’t stress which side is good because it wants to show the reality of war.  To not twist the facts around it shows that soldiers in the Confederate and Union army have a good and a bad side.  I believe the purpose of this movie was to make it seem as historically accurate as possible; taking a particular side would mean only seeing war through one perspective. “Cold Mountain” illustrates that soldiers can relate to their experience fighting in the war despite what side they fought.  Both sides struggled the same way with traitors, family left behind, hunger, and a constant need for security.   It shows graphical scenes of men constantly fighting in gruesome wars, and families awaiting their loved ones for a safe return back home.  This movie is realistic in that it illustrates the struggle for Inman and Ada; a struggle for a solider forced into the war and a struggle for a woman waiting for his return home.  For instance, she is trying to cope living on her own after her father’s death with Inman gone.  It was interesting how the movie did such a great job in portraying how everyone during this era was bound to suffer.  “Cold Mountain” does a phenomenal job in illustrating that a man can still be honorable even though he shows vulnerability.</p>

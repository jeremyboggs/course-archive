				<p>            The lives of slaves are often shrouded in mystery. Growing up as students, we are often taught the bear minimum of our country’s past. We learn the most important details, often excluding supporting facts and events, often excluding details of equal importance. <strong>Runaway ads help historians put these details together in a way to better understand the lives of slaves and the relationships they had with their owners.</strong></p>
<p>            Looking through runaway slave ads, one begins to get an idea of the extremely personal relationship between a slave and his owner. By reading these ads we learn about individuals and the skills they possess, including the most miniscule details. We learn that some slaves had real trades of which they possessed extensive knowledge. The more detailed ads include behavior traits, showing that slaves may not have had hardly any privacy. Living a life of constant supervision would definitely take its toll on a person, making escape a viable option. Slaves were forced to live a life of oppression where their only option of agency was to run away.</p>
<p>            These ads enhance my understanding of colonial American history by giving slaves individual lives. We often learn about slaves as a group, working as a group, living as a group. We often think of slaves as less intelligent, although to no fault of their own with the obvious lack of education and social opportunity. These ads show that in a lot of cases this was not always the truth. Slaves had advanced knowledge of some skills; we learn from ads that some were excellent tailors or excellent blacksmiths. Slaves also show the ability to plan and execute successful escapes; this alone takes at least a fair amount of intelligence to achieve. Ads also give light to areas of behavior, as previously stated. Some ads tell of drunken behavior while others tell of speech habits or limps.</p>
<p>            In the wikipedia article entitled <em>Slavery</em> it says that, “In most institutions of slavery throughout the world, the children of slaves became the property of the master. Local laws varied as to whether the status of the mother or of the father determined the fate of the child; but were usually determined by the status of the mother.” This excerpt shows the cycle of slavery, how a family can lack the opportunity to live a free life or even acquire a free life. Running seems to be the only option left in most cases, an individuals last effort to live a free life.</p>

			<p>It was a good blog post. I think you’re right. We spend too much time learning about slaves as groups, and not learning enough about the slaves themselves. When you think back to what you learned in school, all we ever learned about slaves was that they lived on plantations, had a master and often ran away. Though they never spend time teaching us about the characteristics the slaves possessed or even the difficulty and real danger of trying to escape. The ads really helped show us a new side of slavery and the life endearing problems and dangers that they faced each and everyday. In a way, it makes me feel grateful to be living in a society without that kind of inhumane treatment. </p>
<p>The layout and content of your paper was really good and I liked it. You stuck to the topic of your thesis pretty well. As well, I liked how you had information and thoughts to back up any argument that you presented. The one thing that kind of bugged me was the fact that you didn’t really conclude your paper. You sort of stopped with a thought about something from wikipedia. I am not sure if that was purposefully supposed to be your conclusion, but I thought you could have tied it all together a little better.</p>

			<p>I completely agree with you in that there is definately a way to tie everything together better than stuffing in the required cited quotation and trying to conclude with it, unfortunately I couldn&#8217;t think of anything else to wrap up with and the result was mediocre at best. It was kind of one of those occasions were everything was flowing and then all of a sudden I had a complete block.</p>

			<p>I thought the first ad you referenced was very appealing.  There was so much description about the slaves, even more so than the ad we read about Virginia Gazette in class.  The slaves were each described so clearly, it seemed like every possible characteristic of them were acknowledged, but for the wrong purposes.  It almost seemed like the runaway slaves were written for their individuality.  Their talents were also mentioned whether it was their fluency in English or playing instruments.  The writers’ attention was particularly on their age and complexion when describing their appearance.</p>
<p>It is disappointing that the documentaries we have left are not in a means of recognition.    The ads prove how these slaves are not written descriptively in remembrance of them.  The only intention for these writers’ was so people can find the runaway slaves for a reward in return.  It bothered me the most how there was a wage for the slaves.  To improve your blog, I thought you could have given more examples from the ads and sourced them in your post as quotes.  If you included just a few quotes that flowed with your statements it could have served as some great examples.  Overall, I enjoyed reading your blog, and yes we do need to pay particular attention to slaves and acknowledge them in our history!</p>

			<p>I thought this was a good and insightful post to read. I thought the way the ads were used was very good and could tell that. I really thought good points were made in the post about how just because someone was labeled as a slave that we automatically assumed that they had no skills at all. When in fact that many of the slaves had trades that they were very good at. I guess all of that stuff gets lost in history because we are not taught that in our high school history classes(or at least I wasn&#8217;t). So I thought how you pointed that out was a good job and made sure us as the readers were aware of that.<br />
I thought it written well and I can not really find any fault in it except for a couple. The whole body of the post, I thought the last paragraph seemed out of place and did not seem like a conclusion to me. When I was reading it, it just seemed to me that it belonged earlier in the post. That is just my opinion though. Another thing is that I thought your 2nd and 3rd paragraphs were kind of the same idea. In both of them you talked about the trades they had and how they were dumb like many thought. Just my take on it though.</p>

			<p>I found your post to be a bit dry, but at least it was solid. You supported what you said validly. I say dry because it was straightforward with just the facts. You could be a documentary writer! (Then again, maybe posting comments this late isn&#8217;t the best of my ideas.)</p>
<p>Your conclusion was a little weak, and you may have supplied too many ads as references. As I said, your post is solid, so be glad it can stay afloat.</p>

			<p>I think your paper has a good thesis and your writing was really interesting to me. The ads help us to know lives of slaves and the relationships with their owners by showing individual lives of slaves. I agree with you. Like you said in your paper, the ads include slaves’ appearance, trait, skills and personal relationship with owners. Throughout looking at the individual lives of  slaves, I can understand better about slavery in American history. The ads contain a new side of slavery that I could not find in the books.<br />
You have another interesting point, talented slaves. I actually did not think that there were talented slaves before I read ads. I thought most of the slaves were not educated and did not have special skills. You said that the only option for slaves was runaway and I think so. It is very natural to seek freedom as a human being.<br />
Your writing is good, but I think the last paragraph does not really conclude your whole idea. In my opinion, it would be better if you have strong conclusion. Other than that, I really like reading your writing.</p>

			<p>I enjoyed your paper because I&#8217;m in total aggreement with what you have stated.  Like you said, we almost always look at slaves as part of groups: whether it being working as a group, living as a group, or just being in a group we always look at them in a group.  We never really tend to look at the individual slave itself.  Are they skillful?  Are their escape plans successful?  Are they intelligent?  These are just a few of many questions that I can ask millions of people and they would not have one single clue to what the answer is.  I would tell those who don&#8217;t have a clue to read your paper because it describes the whole slave as an individual and it is worth reading because it is educational.  It is always good as well to have a lot of sources to back up your statements so that was good as well.</p>
<p>The only thing that I can say to you is put more work into your conclusion.  A conclusion is supposed to wrap up all ideas presented in the text, but your conclusion doesn&#8217;t really have a summary.  Just put more work into summarizing your text at the end of your paper and you will be fine.</p>

			<p>Overall, the post was good. I liked your structure and your many supporting facts. The thesis is very well maintained and I learned that the advertisements for runaway slaves help historians piece together their lives. The lives of slaves are never really talked about in the textbooks of American History. We just wonder how their lives were, but now we have a way to take a look inside the life of a slave with the advertisements. It is interesting to me how we can learn so much from this kind of historical documents.</p>
<p>The only problem I saw with your post was the fact that you ended the post so abruptly. You first start talking about another fact of slave life in your last paragraph and never sum up the main argument. I feel that your argument could have been stronger with a concrete finish.</p>

			<p>I think it was really good how you incorporated the ad&#8217;s you used. You were one of the only ones who did and it really added support and concrete evidence to your claims. It was really great also to point out that slaves were in fact intellegent despite what some may think and had their own desintict talents. I also think you supported your thesis well and brought about an interesting topic that Americans do not even know that much about their own history, in regaurd to slavery.</p>
<p>I agree with the others that you should have a better conclusion. It would really tie your blog together and give your agruement a better stance.</p>

			<p>I found your paper very interesting. In my point of view, I do agree with you that the slaves did not have any privacy at all. After all, they were always working and if they did anything wrong, their masters would catch them. With their masters catching their every move, theres no doubt that these ads had every little information about the slaves. It&#8217;s a shame that the slaves didn&#8217;t have or barely had any privacy.</p>
<p>The overall of this paper was easy to follow and the facts blended in with the paragraph. Although I was kind of confused on the last paragraph. It just didn&#8217;t seem to flow with the previous paragraphs above.</p>

			<p>I do not know about you but I have taken about 6 years of actual U.S. History classes in my life time and I feel as if I know a pretty good amount about history. I do agree that we do not get to learn about many individuals, but it is hard to because there isn&#8217;t much documentation about individual slaves and there lives. We get small amounts of information from advertisments but we do not see written accounts of day to day life of slaves until they begin to learn how to write english and collectively feel that slavery should be abolished. We then start seeing writings from freed slaves in northern states and writings from those who wanted to be free. Your writing was excellent, I just do not feel that we have been hidden from learning about slaves as individuals.</p>

			<p>This was an interesting post. I have never actually thought about the fact that we dont know much about slaves individually. I dont think though that it is because it&#8217;s being hiden from us as oppose to it was just never considered important enough back then to take writen account of.<br />
You have a very good style of writing. It definently had a bunch of facts to back up what you had to say. Good job on this post.</p>

			<p>I thought your post was good. I liked the way how you stuck to the topic of your thesis instead of drifting off and writing about something else. You provided good detail about how the relationships of the slaves with their masters and also the lives the slaves led. You make good use of using the ads to support your thesis, they give your post solid evidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Running seems to be the only option left in most cases, an individuals last effort to live a free life&#8221;, I really liked this ending part of your post, it really concluded your post very well.</p>

			<p>Like I said to another post earlier, I completely agree with what you have to say about the runaway ads. Before we would just learn about the slaves in general and in groups and how they were all, as a general group, treated. But now that we read the runaway ads we can closely monitor or study the relationship between a master and their slave. And if we have always learned that slaves were uneducated, then the ad about the slave that ran away and the master described him as literate would prove what we learned in history wrong and the same could be said for other characteristics. Slaves have to acquire knowledge and skills in a household so it is not a surprise that they know how to tailor or do carpentry. However I disagree with you one what you said about them having to a great amount of intelligence to escape. In my opinion all you need to escape is to be treated badly, the will and the courage to run away, after that im sure it didnt really matter to them how they got out, as long as they GOT OUT!</p>

			<p>The first thing I noticed about this blog was that it was very well written from a grammatical and structural standpoint.  The best aspect of the blog, however, was the fact that the author seemed to come to a realization that is very important to the study of history: sometimes nothing can be more instructive than primary sources.  Primary sources, from Anne Frank’s diary to letters written between Churchill and Roosevelt, leave out the historical bias of the historian and allow people to experience a side of history on their own terms.  The author also does a good job reminding us that even though slaves were given no opportunity to excel in the outside world, many of them were able to excel in the trades that were offered to them.</p>
<p>There is very little to criticize, but I think the intimacy of master-slave relationship is being a little blown out of proportion.  I say this only out of disbelief that a man who is willing to treat slaves the way they were treated is going to know any personal information that he cannot see for himself.  In many case I would bet the master would have no knowledge of the slave at all, and that the information on the posters came from a for-men of some kind or even possibly from one of the slave peers.</p>

			<p>I think that you have a point with the ads giving historians an inside look to the relationships between slaves and their owners, but the ads that you provided did not give me the impression that the slave/owner relationship was &#8220;extremely personal.&#8221; Most of the writing in the ads are simply descriptions, and anyone who is around the slave often could tell you the exact same thing. And with the whole cycle of oppression, I do agree with you on that, but keep in mind that not every slave master was so harsh that slaves had no choice to runaway. Some masters gave their slaves the opportunity for education, and were relatively kind to them. The way that you worded your post kind of contradicts your statement about learning about the slaves&#8217; individual lives; it seems to me like you were focusing on the stereotypical slave more than the individual.</p>

			<p>Personally, I thought that your post was very well written. I liked the point you made about the lives of slaves being mysteries in history. It&#8217;s funny how looking back for any personal information on slaves, one has to look at the advertisements for their capture. I also liked how you inferred that the slaves must not have had much privacy. This is a way of looking at slavery that I&#8217;ve never taken into account before and it makes perfect sense. I also agree that in order to escape the cycle of oppression, the slaves HAD TO run away, no matter whether they had a harsh master or not, because in the end it all comes down to being OWNED by somebody.</p>
<p>The only problem I had with your post was your use of the word &#8220;we.&#8221; I feel it would be better to not use such a general word so as not to offend anybody. The one line I found that could be seen as offensive is the line &#8220;we often think of slaves as less intelligent&#8230;&#8221; I personally don&#8217;t think of slaves as less intelligent and im sure there are many others who do not share this view. I think a better choice of words would be &#8220;some Americans&#8221; or something similar. Overall, I felt your post was great though!</p>

			<p>It is sad that we as students have to learn a synopsis of what happened, through a bias opinion almost. Yes we know that the slaves led horrible lives, but with these ads we know a little more about them. We get an intimate connection with them, almost like we saw them or knew them. Through the ads we learn what they liked to do, what they looked like, and get a glimpse into their personal lives. I never though about it that by mentioning all the small personal facts of the slaves lives that they were being watched over very closely, and they probably did not like this at all.<br />
Generally we are taught that slaves were dumb and illiterate, except for the few that were taught by their owners. When in actuality they must have had some brains. It takes courage as well as a crafty mind to plot an escape, especially when they were obviously being watched over so closely. I like how these ads help us get a closer look into the lives on people we see as a group, and not individuals.</p>

			<p>This post was well done. First of all, the thesis statement was strong and clear. I agree with you that we usually don’t get the full story from typical history textbooks, and that these ads help fill in some of the blanks. You also did a good job in supporting your thesis in the body paragraphs by actually trying to “understand the lives of slaves and the relationships they had with their owners”. For example, you made an interesting point that the slaves must have had little privacy because of the fact that some of slave owners knew their personalities in great detail. It is nerve-racking enough just having a boss look over your shoulder when you are at work, so you can imagine how stressed slaves were when their masters looked over them 24/7. </p>
<p>	As I said before, the majority of your post was well done, but I wish you had included references to particular Ads and their slaves within the post, rather than simply listing them at the end. Yet, this is not too big of a deal because I know you wrote the post prior to knowing you had to include hyperlinks. Also, it would have made your post stronger if you looked into how the personal lives of Mulatto slaves, indentured servants, and fully African slaves can differ from one another. There is a lot of evidence within the Ads that they were treated differently. The only other negative aspect of your post was the lack of a conclusion that summed up your claims. Over all, I believe you did a good job.</p>

			<p>I thought you article was very well written, succinct, and informative. It was definitely one of the best articles, grammatically on this subject. I clearly understood your point and I think you inserted enough information, so that you supported your theories with facts and observations. Good use of the word agency, you should get some extra points for that. </p>
<p>The only part of the paper that I thought might have been a little misguided was the first paragraph. The advertisements, in my mind only give a one sided interpretation of the master-to-slave interactions. The ads alone give large amounts of detailed, but without information from the slaves, it is impossible to know if the information is true or not. The master could believe their slaves knew more tasks then they really knew.</p>

			<p>The thesis statement summed what your post was about.  It&#8217;s true that often history books, or the teachers that teach the history class, are biased and select how and which point of view to teach in.  I found myself thinking that slaves isn&#8217;t a whole group of people, that they are in fact individuals working under supervision for very little in return.  It&#8217;s good that you mentioned about how the fate of a child of a slave is not always decided by the mother or father.  But what other options were there in the colonial times?  Did the slave owner ever decided that the child is free or will not work and be educated?  It would be interested if there was a record of this happening.  You are also correct in saying that the slaves would have to be somewhat educated in order for them to come up with an escape plan and succeed in escaping.  I don&#8217;t think that just running would help since they had no place to stay if they did manage to get off the plantation.  It is known, through our class discussions and the ads that the slave owners interacted with their slaves enough to know certain small details that not everyone would know just by looking at them.  This seemed to be the trend thoughout this era, as pointed out by every blog post for this assignment.</p>

			<p>Two things I really liked about this essay was that the thesis, I felt that the thesis was very strong in laying the framework for the rest of the discussion. Second I liked how the essay expounded upon the different qualities some of the slaves possessed and how you are able to view the slave as an individual.</p>
<p>One thing I thought could make this essay a little stronger was to avoid implying that the slave owner and the slave had a &#8216;personal&#8217; relationship. The slave owners would often times be aware of the qualities that their slaves had but that didn&#8217;t mean that they were on a &#8216;personal&#8217; level with the slaves.</p>

			<p>I have to completely agree with your post, the actual lives of slaves were nonexistent, they were owned, they didnt have contol of their own lives.  It seems as if you really undertood the ads and you wanted you write about it. Your thesis statement was very clear and well said. I hate that we are taught the bare minimum in grade school when it comes to slavery. However, I am happy that I am so intrigued with slavery that I did outside reading and research in my spare time. It is unfortunate though that schools do not teach us everything they could.  Your post was very good. I enjoyed reading it.</p>

			<p>I think your post was very interesting. I would never have imagined that a slave owner would develop an actual relationship with their slave. I never would have thought that a slave would be considered intelligent. I&#8217;m not trying to sound rude but with the lack of education and not being able to go to school you would not imagine them to be highly intelligent. From the Ads you find out that slaves are intelligent. In order for them to plan out their getaway they were somewhat educated and not total idiots. If they were not educated or intelligent, they would runaway getting caught eventually. They planned their getaways in ways that not even their master would not come up with. They were also excellent tailors and blacksmiths.   </p>
<p>I definitely agree with you that we do not get the &#8220;whole picture&#8221; of slaves. My past teachers usually mention slavery in groups and do not give them credit individually. We do not learn of the skills they acquire while serving their masters but with the ads you provided us with you really get a whole different picture of slavery.</p>
<p>Overall, you had a very good post and I agree with everything you had written. I liked your style of writing. Good job.</p>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>     In the 1950s it was thought that women only care about the elegance, comfort and other visually appealing features of a car. It was never thought that they would take interest in the mechanical and performance aspect of the car. In modern times women are changing the standard for what type of cars they prefer and it has developed into something very different from the 1950s.  <strong>Over the decades women have developed a different thinking and outlook on the world of automobiles.</strong><br />
   </p>
<p>     I chose to view the video clip <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3qXeZpM__4">“Oldsmobile What Women Want”</a>. This video seemed to be a training video for 1950s Oldsmobile sales associates. It covered what the associates should focus on when selling cars to women. It portrayed woman as people who only cared about the visually appealing features of a car. The video addressed how women only liked the rich quality and the feel of richness in a car. The wide range of colors was something else that the video said appealed to women when purchasing a car. Also mentioned was that women would be interested in the feeling of the interior fabric design like she would on a dress. From this one can assume that the main attire for women was dresses back then. It also talked about how the seat belts of the car were perfect for women because they would not hook the dress under the handle and tear it. This statement again implying that women’s main clothing was a dress.  The video also stated that if the woman is with her husband then the sales associate would not be able to get all of her attention versus if she was shopping alone. So it seems back then if a couple went shopping for a car then it would be the man who made most of the decisions and the women would just accompany the husband but have no real opinion in what car to buy.<br />
     The other video that I viewed was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLnBZA8aMB8">“</a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLnBZA8aMB8">Woman Driver: The Katherine Legge Story Promo”</a>. This told the story of Katherine Legge, a British auto racing driver who is the first women to race a Formula One car in the Champ Car World Series. Everyone predicted that she would fail and not prosper and they said she’s a female in a man’s world. But she worked very hard, was dedicated and proved that she could race a Formula Once car. In a game that crushes the strongest men she won the series opener at Long Beach, in doing this she became the first woman to win a major race in North America. She later went on to win her second and third races at Edmonton and San Jose. This story proves that women have come a long way in the automobile world. It shows that they don’t care merely about the looks of the car nowadays, but that they are interested in understanding the mechanics and performance of the car. I also believe the Legge is a good role model for young girls who are interested in race cars and the mechanics of cars in general. Looking at this story it&#8217;s obvious that women’s thought on cars has no doubt changed from the 1950s.<br />
     </p>
<p>     The Oldsmobile video really just made women look like dummies when it came to cars. It showed them as someone who had no brains and that the sales associate could sell them cars by fooling them into buying a car because of how nice it looked and how elegant and luxurious it was regardless of the performance side of the car. In the 1950s it was thought that the husband would do all the thinking and talking about cars because females were not supposed to know anything about the topic. But looking at the Katherine Legge video it is apparent and evident that women have a new viewpoint in regard to cars. The Legge story shows how a women doesn’t just want to drive a car because of looks but that some women are really into the mechanics and performance aspect of cars.  In 50 years there has never been an intensely competitive female driver in the race world but with Legge’s appearance that has changed. In the 1950s it would have been unimaginable for a woman to drive a race car especially after looking at the Oldsmobile video.  But Legge has proven that women are also interested in car&#8217;s performance and not just the visually appealing and luxurious aspect of cars as they were in the 1950s.<br />
         <br />
     I’m sure though some women still fit into the category of the Oldsmobile video but that’s not the case with many women. Many women nowadays are concerned about the type of performance that their car will give them and that is something they consider when buying a new car. Personally I have a female relative who is very interested in rally cars and she drives a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX.  The Evolution IX is a rally car that is all about performance with very minimal luxury features. So from this we can see that in today’s trends more and more women are favoring the performance and mechanical side of cars versus the elegance and luxury. It is very true that over the decades women have begun to change their perception of cars.<br />

			<p>You did a good post showing how at least one woman was able to break the mold of the stereotype of women and cars. I&#8217;m glad that you acknowledged that it still doesn&#8217;t mean that all women no longer fit the mold of what was thought.</p>

			<p>A very well written post.  Finally, some video proof from the real world and not just movies or television.  You are completely correct that women now look at performance of a car rather than the way that it looks.  I thought that it was funny how in the oldsmobile video, you can sell a woman a car just by the color or how material on the seat feels like.  That Oldsmobile looked like a big gas guzzler of a car and would be very expensive and inconvenient for a woman to maintain.  The Katherine Legge video was a good choice.  I know Danica Patrick is also in the Indy series but she hasn&#8217;t won anything yet.  I did not know about Legge and how she already won a couple races on a different series.  This video also shows how women have changed over the past few decades.</p>

			<p>This was a very interesting post.  The 1st video does a great job of showing the ways in which women were portrayed in the 1950&#8217;s.  I thought the most telling thing about the video was how it showed that if a man was present that it was him you have to convince.</p>
<p>The second portion I thought was kind of a streach.  It has been my experience that both women and men look at whatever cars they personally like, and do not think that this has a gender bias.  On they other hand you did cover yourself by not streaching too far by saying &#8220;I’m sure though some women still fit into the category of the Oldsmobile&#8221;.  You also may have wanted to mention that some men fall into this catagory.</p>

			<p>Your thesis statement has been the most interesting yet.  It was very specific and you were good at making your paragraphs flow together.  You did a good job in persuading the stereotype that women don&#8217;t know anything about cars.  It is a very sexist belief that women don&#8217;t know the basic steps in fixing a car, or changing their tires.  It is definitely true that women know much more than they did years ago.  We do see women racing, or fixing their cars.  It is great that you are putting to our attention this sexist belief.</p>
<p>Your post was good; you were effective in helping me see why you think women are more knowledgeable about cars.  I didn&#8217;t find anything wrong with your post; you carried your thesis out thoroughly.  However, I did find some grammatical errors and some awkward sentences.  By that I mean your choice of words in some of your statements are strange.  For example, &#8220;Looking at this story it’s obvious that women’s thought on cars has no doubt changed from the 1950s.&#8221;  Overall you did a great job; I enjoyed reading your post!</p>

			<p>Very good post, your thesis was strong and the video sources you used were not only interesting but they completely served their purpose in your post. You made all your points clear and you did a great job of supporting everything you stated. I had not previously thought about something like how women look at cars or how women are perceived to look at cars in the 50s compared to today, but there is definately a drastic difference. Great post.</p>

			<p>Your post was very interesting. You looked at the topic from a different point of view, which was refreshing. The subtle but important details you pointed out from the first clip were great. Such as, not getting the woman&#8217;s full attention when she was with her husband and the husband most likely making the decision. And the fact that they used the word dress in many circumstances, allowing one to assume that a dress was the typical clothing for a woman then. Also, the clip only stated that a woman would enjoy the color, feel, and perhaps price of a car. Not the engine work, maintenance, or any actual car facts other than appearance.<br />
Your choise to show an actual documentary clip in a real woman racer was good. It shows that a woman can care about the performance and inside workings of a car and that she is probably a very big role model and inspires other girls to be interested in cars&#8217; workings too. It is good for a woman to be knowledgeable on the subject of cars, not just for racing, but in everyday life when they need to buy a car or have it repaired.<br />
You were even realistic in saying that a lot of women today probably are not knowledgeable about cars and I completely agree because I myself have no idea how a car works or how to fix one and I did buy my car on appearance.<br />
It was hard to pick out a flaw in your post at all. I feel that the last paragraph was a little thrown in, but it also added value and personal experience to the post. Perhaps it would have worked better in a different location instead of the last thought after reading the post. You used good examples and explaind them clearly. Overall, it was interesting and excellent.</p>

			<p>I thought your post was refreshing and new. You chose to focus on a different subject, and I thought it was interesting. I never really made a connection between women and cars. I agree with you, women I think have changed their outlook on cars and &#8220;man&#8221; subjects. We care about the inside and quality of the car, not just &#8220;how pretty it looks.&#8221; </p>
<p>Your post was good. I liked how you used the video and commercial to really make your points clear, and you were actually able to. Your conclusion was really good: as you wrapped up the whole post very well. I think that maybe you could have focused in your thesis more, but other than that, really good!</p>

			<p>In your post you did a good job of showing how womens perceptions of cars has changed over the years.  I especially liked you story about the female British formula one driver.  I watch formula one races once in a while and I know that it requires extremely fast reflexes as well as physical strength and stamina.</p>

			<p>Before and now, commercials appeal to a person&#8217;s interests so that they can sell their product. Obviosly because of how women were a few decades ago, the best way to sell a car to them is by making it look pretty, because as we all know by now that&#8217;s how women were back then. Be a good house wife, cook, clean and look pretty next to their husband. So a nice looking car with just the right fabric and look adds to all of that. But women now are 180 degrees different than women back then in general. So when they buy a car, they&#8217;re thinking about family and their kids and the trips they have to take using the car they&#8217;re going to buy and so they look for comfort and safety. Therefore a car commercial now a day would probably show how a car reacts to an accident to get a man or a woman to buy it. Tv changes with time.</p>

			<p>I definitely agree with you that in general women are more interested in the mechanical aspects of cars now than they were in the fifties. I also think you did a good job trying to get a sense of what the relationship between women and cars was like in the fifties. One thing that I didn’t like about your post was that you made it seem like, until the last paragraph, that pretty much all women nowadays are into car mechanics. It probably would be good to make this clear earlier in your essay. Also you are incorrect in saying that “In 50 years there has never been an intensely competitive female driver in the race world”. There have been several, one of which being Danica Patrick. </p>
<p>One thing that would have made your post even better if you explained why women are becoming more interested in automobiles, or at least propose some plausible reasons why. Overall, I think your ideas were interesting and that you did a good job.</p>

			<p>Your topic is very interesting to me because you have different topic from other 50s women posts. It is refreshing. Your thesis was strong and clear and both Oldsmobile and Legge story video clips support your idea very well. Especially, Legge’s story really shows that how women changed overtime. I actually never thought about the connection between women and cars. I see that women’s concern about car have changed over time. I realized that women’s concern is definitely different from the past while I read your post. I also agree with you that many women today may not have knowledge about cars. Your post was great, but I think your last paragraph is not really concluded all your idea. The last paragraph should be your conclusion that puts your argument into the big picture. However, your conclusion is more like an example and evidence that support your argument.</p>

			<p>After reading this post, I thought your thesis was very interesting. It was both strong and clear and the points that you mention obviously supported your thesis. The sentences overall was smooth and you didn’t have much errors. I like the way how you mention that women in particular are very knowledgeable about cars and from a women perspective, it means a lot to them. I do agree that from a women’s point of view, they look at a car as if it is a materialistic object then just a ride. Honestly, I didn’t fine anything bad about this post. All the facts were supported by the video and there is absolutely nothing wrong about this post.</p>

			<p>You did a great job in explaining your clips and also did a good job when picking them out.  I like how you compared that women are looking for performance these days and i think you might be right but how ever there are some who do go for looks and style.  This was an interesting post and i would have never thought of comparing cars from the 50&#8217;s to women and car these days.</p>

			<p>Your post was an interesting topic. I suppose it is true that most women back in the 50&#8217;s left their husbands to make the decisions on cars, however their are always exceptions and I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re were some women who preferred stylish cars and actually made the decision for their husbands. I like how you incorporated the video, which really helped your thesis remain strong. In my case most girls that I have been associated with could really care less about cars. It&#8217;s like when me and my friends talk about cars they just kind of zone out, but I have noticed that alot of girls are driving vey materialistic cars. I&#8217;ve seen some girls who have put lots of money into cars in order to increase their horsepower and style of the car. Good Job, I enjoyed it.</p>

			<p>This was an interesting topic. There is not much debate about the issue of womens and cars as I would like there to be. I agree with you that back in the days women didn&#8217;t know anything about the mechanics of a car. In fact is was considered inapproproate for them to even know anything about cars. They were expected to wear clean white dresses, and keep them clean throughout the day. Coming near a car would only dirty their dress. Women today are more aware of the makings of the, but still the majority don&#8217;t know much about them. They understand the basics and concept of a car, but not the details. However, todays women chooses not to learn, rather than society deciding that women should not know about cars.</p>

			<p>You chose a very interesting aspect of the video to highlight.     The decades-long relationship of women and cars HAS changed a lot.  I&#8217;m sure that even back then there were women who were interested in cars, but I&#8217;ll bet it was a taboo for women in general.  Not only as far as men were concerned, but probably in the eyes of other women as well.  My mother is a good example of how things have changed.  While my parents were married, she knew nothing of cars, and was often frustrated when she felt that she had been taken advantage of by greedy car mechanics.  After my parents divorced, she took on the responsibilities of purchasing and maintaining the family transportation, she became much more knowledgeable, even though she&#8217;ll never be the kind to want a performance car.</p>
<p>The only negative thing I could say is that your focus is kind of narrow with the second video.  Women racecar drivers are still few, but many women are more knowledgeable about cars.</p>

			<p>This is very very very interesting post I ever read, because your thesis is really interesting. I never thought about how women think about the world of automobiles. In my mind, I don’t think women know anything about automobiles, and I think women want just get a car. Which it has four wheel as long as it drive. Now women want to drive better and fast car, they just don’t want to good looking car. After saw your video clips I ever understand your post more deeply. This is well done post, I really enjoyed read it. you really open up my mind and my eye, and you showed me what is good blog look like.</p>

			<p>As a huge car fanatic, I feel like I can relate to this post a lot. I enjoyed the way that your wrote it, and it capitvated my attention. At first I didn&#8217;t really accept women racing cars, but as the years went on and it became more and more popular, I just forgot about those notions. This is a prime example at how women are completely equal in todays society versus back then. Ashley Force, daughter of famous racer John Force, Im pretty sure was the champ of the Pro Outlaw Street Class in NHRA drag. Now that is cool. The whole part about womens dresses matching the cars was a good comparison too, it tests the myth that &#8220;You can judge a person by the type of car they drive&#8230;&#8221; Well done</p>

			<p>Your thesis was supported very well in your post. I think by looking at the progression of female drivers wantes and needs, you made your post much more interesting than focusing on the typical &#8220;house wife&#8221; scenario. I enjoyed reading your post, because it was clear and informative. I can not see anything in your paper that i would change. Well done.</p>

			<p>I loved how your blog was different. It was not just about women in a kitchen. I took different points away from the videos though. When the woman was buying a car I did not think about how she should be thinking about performance, but how she could be swindled with a few pieces of material and an emblem. Although women were housewives in the 1950&#8217;s, I do not believe that they were severely uneducated. Women knew about prices, especially since they were housewives and did most of the shopping for the family. Women back then knew about what was a good deal. I was very surprised that a man was not with her at the dealership. That showed some independence and accountability from the man that I did not even know really exisisted at that time.</p>

			<p>This was an excellent post.  The best thing about your blog post was your thesis statement.  It was the best one I have read so far.  Even though it was short, it got to the point and was extremeley easy to understand what it was you were going to say in your body.  I agree with you that women are more interested in the automobles then they have been in the past.  This was a very interesting post and not one I would think of because most people to think of writing about women and automobiles.  I really learned a lot from this post and I thank you for that.  </p>
<p>The only critique I have is the use of your words in sentences.  It seemed to me that you weren&#8217;t using the right words in all your sentences and it got really confusing to read and figure out what you were saying.  Just a few grammatical errors also.  </p>
<p>Good job, I enjoyed it very much.</p>

			<p>I think this was a very well written blog i enjoyed reading it. Your examples were unique and well choosen. Women have become independent and are on the go just like men. The old house wife days are in the past and you can find men and women  competing for the same jobs. Over all good post well done i really enjoyed reading your work.</p>

			<p>I really enjoyed reading your post, I thought it was very well written. I agree that in the past women really weren’t into the mechanical aspects of the car, they were into how nice it looked. But I still think that it applies now in most cases as well. My sister is very into how the car looks and wants a Range Rover because it’s “pretty”. I, on the other hand, had a car that was a type of racer car and when people saw it automatically thought that it was a boy’s car.  it’s not a good thing that most woman are thought to be less informed about cars, but I don’t think that it’s as bad as it was in the fifties.</p>

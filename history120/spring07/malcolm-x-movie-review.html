			<div class="entry">
				<p><strong>     The movie Malcolm X does an excellent job of portraying the story of Malcolm X, also known as El Hajj Malik El Shabbaz, during one of the most turbulent times in America’s history. </strong>The movie is based upon the true events surrounding the life of Malcolm X. During his lifetime, Malcolm went through many drastic changes in the way he thought and what he preached, going from one extreme to a more moderate view. He was raised in a society that hated people of a darker color. He was a bright student who aspired to become a lawyer, but had his dreams shot down by a teacher who said his color would be a big obstacle for him to overcome. Malcolm’s life spun into turmoil and trips to jail became normal for him. While in jail, Malcolm was introduced to a new movement taking shape in the African American society. This movement was called The Nation of Islam. It preached black supremacy and an extreme hatred for the white man. Malcolm got involved in the Nation of Islam and rose in their ranks. He became an advocate for The Nation of Islam, but eventually found corruption in it and broke from the organization. After a pilgrimage to the city of Mecca, Malcolm’s views changed to Orthodox Islam. He began to preach tolerance for peoples of all races and did not fear for his own life. He knew that many people wanted him dead due to his outlook. Malcolm was assassinated at the hands of the Nation of Islam, having lived only a handful of years.</p>
<p>     The movie’s overall purpose is to portray a very accurate description of the story of a controversial character of history. It follows Malcolm’s life from childhood to his death and does an excellent job of getting the story across. The movie also serves the purpose of educating the public of the chaotic times America lived through. This movie helps in showing what certain beliefs and ideas can lead to. It shows how a people who were looked down upon, ridiculed and killed were feeling and how racism can lead to an equal amount of hatred and tension. This time of history should never be lived through again be any people no matter where they are in the world. Using the story of a famous historical figure that lived through this time and had a great impact on society is much more effective than using a fictional character. Audiences can relate or understand history much better when it is seen through the eyes of someone who actually lived through it.</p>
<p>     The director, Spike Lee, portrays the life of Malcolm as accurately as possible. He does an excellent job of cramming 39 years of anxiety and confusion into three short hours. The point of view used is as if you yourself were there. An example of this would be the assassination scene at the end of the movie. The view and angles make you feel as if you are experiencing the assassination in front of your eyes. The reaction of the people and his wife are very realistic and impressive. The director wanted to make it realistic so that the audience would be able to understand and comprehend who Malcolm X really was and the great impact he made in American history. He wanted to portray what Malcolm X stood for, what his ideas were, and he wanted to show for what reasons this great man was assasinated so that the American public can appreciate who he was.</p>
<p>     At the end of the movie, the narrator claims that Malcolm was not afraid to die because he loved his people, however after reading Malcolm’s letter he wrote back home while in Mecca proves other wise. Spike Lee seems to be implying at the end that Malcolm is still supporting the Black Nationalist movement, however in his letter he says, “But on this pilgrimage, what I have seen, and experienced, has forced me to re-arrange much of my thought patterns previously held, and to toss aside some of my previous conclusions.” He also says, “I have never before seen sincere and true brotherhood practiced by all colors together, irrespective of their color.” These two quotes show that Malcolm became an advocate for Islam during the last years of his life, he tossed aside his pervious conclusions. You can see that he is advocating Islam in another quote from the letter, “if white Americans could accept the Oneness of God, then perhaps, too, they could accept in reality the Oneness of Man…”</p>
<p>     This movie seems to be aimed at a variety of audiences. It can be intended for youth who are going through hard times in their life, due to the fact that Malcolm went through many turbulent times in his life, which even led him to jail. The movie also seemed to be aimed at generations who lived through this time and would like to see an accurate description of what happened. This movie could also be aimed at Muslim people because Malcolm X became a famous caller to the true message of Islam and thus he became someone who the Muslims should learn and know about. He became a part of Islamic history in a way because of his beliefs as a true Muslim who wanted to spread the message of Islam to all people. Since he became a part of the history of Muslims, then Muslims should want to learn about his life. Non-Muslims could also learn a lot from this film, they could learn the trials and tribulations that Malcolm X faced in his life and how at the end he came out on top by accepting the pure message of Islam. People who disliked Malcolm X might dislike him due to misleading and false facts about him. But if they were to watch this film then they could really understand Malcolm&#8217;s life and clear up their misunderstandings.</p>
<p>     Of course, this movie would also be enjoyed by history buffs, who would want to compare the movie to the reality of the situation at the time. This film is a mix of two genres. It is a drama but at the same time it is a documentary of sorts. Spike Lee tries very hard to capture the feeling and passion of the life of Malcolm X. This movie does not talk about Malcolm’s personal issues and problems and much as it displays Malcolm’s role in the society. The character is portrayed very well by Denzel Washington. His acting is exceptional and he follows through with the part beautifully. Therefore, the movie Malcolm X, directed by Spike Lee, does a good job of portraying events that took place that brought Malcolm to his final conclusion.</p>

			<p>.A very good and well written post! In today’s society, everyone around the world is so moved by the people who made a difference in the world. As for Malcolm X, he was one of those people made a difference in the world. What I like about this post is that the post author clearly tells us what Malcolm X did and how he became an historical figure. Another thing that I like about this post is that the post author included examples from the movie including this sentence “But on this pilgrimage, what I have seen, and experienced, has forced me to re-arrange much of my thought patterns previously held, and to toss aside some of my previous conclusions.” What I didn’t like about this post is that it had a few grammatical errors. Another thing that I didn’t like about this post is that the post author only included the fact that Malcolm X was someone who made a difference. They didn’t really critique the movie. After reading this post, it made me feel that I want to watch this movie in the future.</p>

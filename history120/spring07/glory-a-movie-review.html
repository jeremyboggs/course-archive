				<p>The movie “Glory” is about the 54<sup>th</sup> Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry: it was made mostly of Blacks whether they were free blacks from the North or run away slaves from the South. It is told from the view of and follows the story of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw and leads up to the Battle of Fort Wagner at Charleston, South Carolina, on July 18, 1863.  <strong>The purpose of this movie is to demonstrate different aspects of the Civil War, including highlighting the much ignored role of blacks during the war, the racial inequalities present on both sides of the war, as well as displaying the true bravery, courage, and determination not by the soldiers, but of also the men who believed in themselves and their cause. </strong>The movie is mostly based on letters written by Colonel Shaw during the civil war.<br />
Most of the information given to us bout the civil war in history classes or history books gives us the white perspective and the general civil war, this movie gave us the black perspective and highlighted their role in the war, something that is ignored by everyone else. It uses history to tell us the story of the Black men in the 54<sup>th</sup> regiment, and it does so with many details and tells us the story very accurately.  From the declaration that was set at the beginning of the movie that said “ any black man taken prisoner by the Union uniform will be primarily executed” to the decrease in their monthly wage in comparison to a white soldier ($13 to $10), we were shown how exactly they had been suffering from the very beginning and being treated unfairly. It showed how the colored men really wanted to accomplish something and how they wanted to prove themselves even though it eventually took them dying that changed everybody’s impression about them. For example when they found out that they could be executed or slaved if they were caught, they had the choice to either flee or stay, but to the colonel’s surprise not one of them had left by the next morning. Also when they found out that their wage was less than the white soldiers they said “black men take a bullet just like white men do” and then they started ripping up their papers to prove to everybody that they were not in it just to get the money but to also make a point.</p>
<p>For the main part, Glory is historically accurate. It looks like a great deal of effort went into getting most of the details correct. The main events that took place at that time are shown exactly as they were and the main characters were all real. Some of the other characters might not have been though, but were put just to emphasize the role of a black soldier to us. For example Thomas, who was Colonel Shaw’s friend before they went into war, is very fictional. It is said that he is the character that most probably resembles William Carney, who was the first black soldier to receive the Medal of Honor, but it is still a stretch. William Carney was an ex-slave while Thomas was a freeborn Bostonian. Seeing him get wounded and still want to fight further with Colonel Shaw instead of going back to Boston, and then picking up the flag at the battle when he is still wounded leaves an effect on us as, which is why it was ment to be there. We connected with him and felt bad for him at all the right parts of the movie and that was just a small fraction of what the black soldiers had to go through. The same thing is done with the character of Private Trip, he is a troubled black man and they show us how he ran off to get shoes which caused him to get whipped, which is the punishment for such a thing. But, something touched the Colonel when he saw the whips on his back that he had gotten previously and when he talked to a fellow black soldier he knew they had needed the shoes that he had been asking for a while and not getting, of course because his regiment was black. He then goes to the place where they supply regiments with things they need and fought a white man. There is nothing in articles or websites that tell us that happened but it adds to the sense of connection that Shaw had with his regiment and how he was different from Colonel Montgomery (who also had a black regiment, but used them to burn towns down and steal from people). It is said that the movie is based of the letters from Colonel Shaw, so maybe heroes made in the movie are based on some characters that Shaw had talked about in his letters. They also show us how the black army was not intended to be used for battle first but only manual labor, and how still they did not give up. They worked their labor but when it came time for their battle they put their all into it and died trying to help their country.<br />
Glory is a historical war film; it is made for anyone who’s interested in civil war historical movies or African American pride or etc. It brings the period of the Civil War to life and allows us to emotionally connect with the characters and the respective scenes they are associated with, via their effective performances, costumes, and staging of the various battles. Because of this, we feel for the soldiers on a greater emotional level because unlike other historical war movies, this movie gives connection and humanity a greater priority towards the audience rather than strategy, epic battle action, and blood and gore.</p>

				<p>This may be one of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMH0bHeiRNg">funniest / coolest</a> guys to ever live. His depictions of classic to modern dance styles makes you chuckle to yourself a little bit. If any of you have ever done any of these dances, you know that little chuckle I&#8217;m talking about. This clip emphasizes not only the different styles of dance, but also the music and attitude that went with the time. <strong>If history is bound to repeat itself, which I belive it does, we will see some of these moves come back in a crazy RAGE!</strong></p>
<p>Just think about it. When we were kids back in the late 80&#8217;s break dancing was at an all time record high. It was what everyone did. Then it kind of dyed off and Rock was the king of dance with crazy mosh pits and people flailing around like crazy. Now days its hip hop, with its bump and grind, and hip hop dance moves, but you still see some resemblance from some of the dance steps. Crip Walking looks an awful lot like a break dancers top rock, just with a little bit more style and some modern day enhancements. Hip Hop dances are similar to moves you would have only done at the disco, while rockin&#8217; your favorite pair of bell bottoms, just more speed and a little bit more pep to your step. Even moves like the chicken dance are still in use today at things like weddings. I know I&#8217;ve flapped the wings recently.<br />
It&#8217;s strange to think that in the short time that we have experienced in this world, how much has changed and evolved. I mean back in the day New Kids on the Block Jeans were the coolest thing along with the Zack Morris haircut. If you had those two super attributes of the time, man you were the coolest cat on the block. I can&#8217;t wait for the return of break dancing, I&#8217;ve even got an old school pair of white adidas for when the day comes.</p>

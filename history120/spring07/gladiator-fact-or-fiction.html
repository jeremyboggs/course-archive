			<div class="entry">
				<p>The Film <u>Gladiator</u>, released in 2000, staring Russell Crowe is on my all-time top favorite movies. I enjoy this action packed movie every time I watch it. For the assignment we had to dig deep in to the historical fiction of the movie. I began with research on several different website relating to the movie and the facts behind its historical events, and what I read was surprising.</p>
<p>            The Movie its self is true in most aspects, except for some small details such as characters and actual events that took place. Obviously the Roman Empire was real, and there were really Gladiators that fought to the death. Although not every fight was to the death, it seemed as if every fight in the movie was. Another false part of the movie was that the main character, Maximus, did not exist at all. He was merely put into the plot to be able to create a heroic character.</p>
<p>            The movie gave a great sense of what ancient Greece was like in 180 AD. The attention to detail of the costumes and the scenery was fantastic; this captured the minds of the audience and put them in the time period. I greatly enjoyed this film because it was entertaining yet, it was based of actual events of an ancient society. I was unable to differentiate the fact from the fiction in the movie until I did the research on this must see movie.</p>

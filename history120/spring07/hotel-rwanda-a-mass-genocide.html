				<p align="center">Hotel Rwanda-The Mass Genocide</p>
<p>                Imagine if our country went through the equivalent of 266 World Trade Center bombings in 100 days. Also imagine, instead of terrorists perpetrating these acts, it was a militia comprised of neighbors, family, and friends. In 1994, a war began when Hutu extremists waged war on the minority Tutsis initiating a terrible campaign of genocide that killed over 800,000 people and displaced and entire nation. “Hotel Rwanda”, a film by Terry George, is the true story of the four star Les Milles Collines Hotel in Kigali, Rwanda during a time of turmoil. As the world ignored the people of Rwanda, this hotel gave refuge to over 1,000 people seeking safety in the center of a civil war. <strong><u>Hotel Rwanda</u> gives life to the 1994 mass genocide by telling the terrible story of Rwanda through one man and his struggle to keep his family alive.<br />
</strong><strong>            </strong>In Rwanda, over 800,000 were slaughtered as the Tutsi and Hutu tribes struggled over control of the country. Encouraged by bigotry, racist Hutu radio and the assassination of the country’s president, Juvenal Habyarimana, the Hutu started annihilating the Tutsis as mob rule prevailed. But unlike so many cases of genocide, where there are clear religious or racial differences, the Tutsi and Hutu are nearly identical, only differentiated by the previous colonial government, which taught one group to hate the other.  As friends attacked friends, neighbors kill neighbors and children become the target for the Hutu who seek to kill the next generation of the Tutsi, Paul Rusesabagina  realizes that his home, as he knew it, was gone forever. Rusesabagina is the manager of an elite resort in Rwanda, where the tourists come for vacation, and where the country’s elites come for a free drink and good conversation. Once the slaughter starts, his hotel quickly becomes an island in a sea of destruction. Within days, United Nations peacekeepers have set up camp outside his front door, hundreds of desperate Tutsis rush to him looking for shelter and safety, and he soon finds his family, as well as 1,200 Rwandans under his care as they hide from the hell that exists only miles away. <u>Hotel Rwanda</u> is really the story of this struggle as seen through Rusesabagina’s eyes.<br />
                <u>Hotel Rwanda</u>  is meant to touch the people that were sheltered from this story. Much of the media in the western world ignored Rwanda’s cry for help as hundreds of thousands were being massacred. The governments and the United Nations ignored cries for help from Rwandans they called friends.  In the movie, Colonel Oliver, a UN official, talked to Paul Rusesabagina and shed light to how he thought the western world felt about Rwanda. <br />
                You’re dirt, we think your dirt.<br />
                Who is we.<br />
                The west, all the super powers, everything you believe in Paul, they think your dirt. They think your dung. You’re worthless.<br />
                I’m afraid I do not understand what you are saying sir.<br />
                Come on, don’t bullshit me Paul. You’re the smartest man here. You got them all eating out of your hands. You could own this freaking hotel except for one thing, you’re black. You’re not even a nigger. You’re an African.<br />
                This quote struck a nerve in me that I believe affected the entire audience. When the tragedy in Rwanda occurred I was only 9 years old. As I recall, I do not remember hearing about the crisis in Rwanda or anything about it as the years have gone on.  I may have been sheltered from it but as far as the audience goes, I believe we were all highly disengaged in the happenings of Rwanda.  This tragedy was not decades ago, it was in the age of high speed communication. Any country would have been suitable to go in and protect the civilians against the renegade, yet no one stepped up.  <br />
                Paul Rusesbagina’s story was told to bring a heroic storyline to a gruesome genocide. His version is meant to tell the whole country’s account beyond the facts and figures that we could see on the news. He brought life to what occurred in Rwanda, with few things changed in the movie.  Rusesbagina’s courage to keep his family alive was just one illustration of the many different stories and accounts that people reported after the war. Not intervening in the war was a bad and forgotten move by the entire world. Hotel Rwanda gives light to a story forgotten or unheard of by many, and lived by many more.</p>

			<p>I saw this movie a couple years ago and I loved it. The way how the main character tries to save many lives is very kind and courageous. This movie reminds me of the holocaust which was basically like a genocide. Reading this post, I think the author wrote down the major facts that happened in the movie. I like the part how they include the quote “You’re dirt, we think your dirt. Who is we. The west, all the super powers, everything you believe in Paul, they think your dirt. They think your dung. You’re worthless. I’m afraid I do not understand what you are saying sir. Come on, don’t bullshit me Paul. You’re the smartest man here. You got them all eating out of your hands. You could own this freaking hotel except for one thing, you’re black. You’re not even a nigger. You’re an African.” This quote clearly tells us that no one was treated fair and no one should ever be treated like this. What I really didn’t like about this post is that it was more of a movie review then just telling us the art behind it</p>

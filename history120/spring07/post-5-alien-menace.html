			<div class="entry">
				<p>Every race has a few stereotypes that follow them where they go.  From Asian people being good at math to Jewish people being very greedy with money, stereotypes have no mercy.  It is very difficult not to offend anyone since there are so many people, keeping racism a touchy subject.  Even in class, when we talk about race or a group of people, we know what the answers are or what the professor is looking for, but since that race is represented in the class, we do not want to offend them and simply try not to be called on.  <strong>Stereotypes label races a certain way and that certain way is how the majority of the population see them as.</strong></p>
<p>A few things have changed, since the 19<sup>th</sup> century, but there still remain stereotypes that continue to label races in order to simplify things.  I found a few pictures in the Library of Congress archives that depict typical <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/436320671/in/photostream/">African-American</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/436320677/in/photostream/">Chinese-Americans</a> in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century.  In the picture with the small child enjoying his watermelon, you see a large chunk of it already eaten.  As you know, African-Americans like watermelon, chicken, and grits, this has been a stereotype for a long time and is even the title to the Nappy Roots album, “Watermelon, Chicken, &amp; Gritz” with a “z” because it makes it that much cooler.  The little boy, named “Watermelon Jake”, is not wearing any shoes and appears to be sitting on a table.  So at this time period, African-Americans are poor people who cannot afford shoes and enjoy watermelon in the summer time to keep them cool.</p>
<p>In the other photo, entitled “The Chinese Must Go!” there are several small pictures showing several stereotypes of Chinese people.  In one picture, there is a line of people waiting to hand there clothes to the Chinese cleaner man who is already hard at work.  In another picture, there is a man inspecting the clothes that a Chinese tailor has finished for him.  In yet another picture, there is a man looking to buy cigars in a Chinese owned Cigar shop.  These are stereotypes of jobs that the Chinese had and in every single picture, they are still wearing their typical Chinese clothing, while the white people have regular trousers, coats, hats, and shoes.</p>
<p>Some of these stereotypes are still valid today.  Of course some of them are not also.  In a photo that I found in the Google search engine, there is a picture of <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/436332436/in/photostream/">Tupac</a>.  This “Gangsta” rapper emerged late in the 20<sup>th</sup> century to become one of the biggest rap icons in history.  This photo also depicts what a typical gangster is, I guess, supposed to look like.  From a huge tattoo across his stomach stating, “THUG LIFE” with a bullet as the letter “i”, to his jeans slung low passed his boxer briefs, to his backwards bandana.  Yet he finds it necessary to wear a crucifix outside of it all.  This “thug” was later gunned down in 1996 in a drive by with his murder yet to be solved.  So when Tupac became rich and famous, he wore better clothes, had more jewelry and was very influential in the music world, but little Watermelon Jake was just a little kid with no shoes enjoying his juicy watermelon.</p>
<p>In the last photo, I found what appears to be a web advertisement for a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/436332440/in/photostream/">Chinese tailor</a>.  There are dressed in there traditional clothing and the older man is working on a piece of clothing in the background.  The bottom of the picture states “We don’t have a fancy website, but we make the most beautiful dresses.”  It also says that they are made by hand.  This made me think, “Did they wear those clothes on purpose to attract customers?”  You want to make money when you start a business, but I do not think that you have to wear something or look a certain way that you would not normally look in order to attract customers, your work should speak for itself.</p>
<p>Stereotyping is a serious problem that people have dealt with for a very long time.  Some of these stereotypes, although there is some truth, hold back the race from breaking free of the mold that society have put them in.  There are a few pioneers, such as Dave Chappelle, Carlos Mencia, and the creators of South Park that have confronted stereotypes and made them public so that everyone knows what it does.  Now I’m going to get out of my house that has like 20 people in it, drive to school in my Toyota Corolla with Wal-Mart spinners, and stop by Taco Bell before I get to class.</p>

			<p>This in it self is a very touchy subject. Stereotypes are more oftenly not used in a Negative mannor; and i believe you approuched this subject very well with a mature level of analysis. In your first photo, is says just that. A little african american boy is eating watermelon. I agree with you whole Heartedly, this is a serious problem that offends some people. but i think that if you are with your friends and they are ok with messing around it can be fun.</p>

			<p>I really liked your post. I think you used good examples throughout your post. When I was looking online at stereotypes, I also found a bunch depicting African Americans eating watermelon. (http://photos21.flickr.com/27669062_e229286ed1.jpg). I think it&#8217;s interesting how these stereotypes have lasted over time, which makes me agree with you when you say that there are some truth to them. While I know not every African American likes watermelon, and not every Chinese American works in dry cleaning, it is easy to see how these things start.</p>
<p>I also really liked your ending sentence, &#8221; Now I’m going to get out of my house that has like 20 people in it, drive to school in my Toyota Corolla with Wal-Mart spinners, and stop by Taco Bell before I get to class.&#8221; I think it&#8217;s really good closing and you related it to stereotypes people may place on you.</p>
<p>The main critizism I have is a couple things didn&#8217;t seem to make sense, or flow well with the rest of your blog. Like the concluding sentence in the paragraph about Tupac. I didn&#8217;t understand how Watermeleon Jake related, or at least how you related it in the end sentence. I also think that your thesis could be a little bit more well developed. When you say, &#8220;this is how the majority of the population sees them as&#8221;, I don&#8217;t think you really proved this.</p>

			<p>You did a pretty good post. I liked how you proved just how touchy the subject is by referencing the class &#8220;discussions&#8221; we had on it. I also liked how you ended your paper. I&#8217;m a big fan of sarcasm and ironic humor.</p>
<p>Your thesis however seems to just be the definition of a stereotype to me. it isn&#8217;t really something that needs to be proven to me.</p>

			<p>I think you did a good job of addressing the photo with the black kid sitting and eating the watermelon.  I agree that this is a very common stereotype that is not necessarily true.  Not all black people even like watermelon or fried chicken.<br />
I am not so sure that i agree that Carlos Mencia confronts stereotypes.  Mencia likes to use stereotypes in his comedy and I do not think that he has anything against them.</p>

			<p>I agree with all of your statements about stereotypes.  I believe that what we perceive certain people to behave or act in a certain way because of their race is because of their past.  My professor told me the other day when she saw a white woman walking behind her she was relieved it wasn&#8217;t a black man.  I believe people tend to think negatively about someone because the media portrays them in a negative way.  Black men are rarely shown in a business suit graduating from a prestigious college.  A segment on Oprah noted a black father saying he wants his son to be successful, but the only way for a black man to become successful is for him to become a rapper.</p>
<p>I can relate to your post because being Korean, people judge me to think that I am great in math.  I also live by stereotypes everyday because of my race.  However, this is what everyone probably goes through.  I still like there is still some what of a separation in America today which disappoints me.  You stirred up much of a response from me because your blog was well written.  The only thing I would recommend is for you to add what we can do to prevent stereotypes and negative judgments.  I enjoyed reading your post.</p>

			<p>I thought your ads were good and you made good comments about the ads. I also found a lot of ads that had African Americans eating watermelon and fried chicken in ads. It is a shame that stuff like this has to be associated with people. For some reason I never heard about Chinese people being good taylors. That was new to me so I can not really make a comment about that because I never heard that before. But I&#8217;m guessing because a lot of nice clothes are made in Asia that, that stereotype can be attached to them, when it shouldn&#8217;t be. </p>
<p>It is funny because I am Korean and back home no one ever stereotyped me because of my race. I came from a small country town and I was never used to it, until I came down to school at Mason and then it seemed different races are looked at differently and stereotyped because of that. So it was new to me. My negative comment about this post is I didn&#8217;t think tupac was a good ad to use. I don&#8217;t know why, I just think there could of been a better ad or done something else. I didn&#8217;t think the right points were made about it. Maybe I&#8217;m just looking at it wrong. Is it really stereotyping someone calling them gangsta? I guess I can&#8217;t make my point like I want to, so forget what I said.</p>

			<p>You pointed out some very good stereotypes that people see everyday. One I’ve noticed at my work since we started serving sweet tea was about black people absolutely loving sweet tea. Everyone jokes around about it being too sweet for themselves, but perfect for one of our black coworkers. He laughs about the stereotype too, but even though it doesn’t bother him, it is still pushing on the stereotype. I like how you mention Carlos Mencia and Dave Chappelle. They use humor to point out stereotypes that people sometimes don’t even notice. Humor can be a good tool to point out stereotypes without being offensive, like the way you used it in the end. So I guess it’s probably time for me to turn in my tan Toyota corolla for a convertible or something.</p>

			<p>I really liked your post, you had many good points that I was able to relate to. For example when you said &#8220;Even in class, when we talk about race or a group of people, we know what the answers are or what the professor is looking for, but since that race is represented in the class, we do not want to offend them and simply try not to be called on.&#8221; Being from a minority myself, it bothers me first hand when people stereotype about others. I&#8217;m middle eastern and the main stereotype about us is that &#8220;all arabs and muslims are terrorists&#8221;, don&#8217;t you think if that was true then there would be a lot more bombing happening around the world?? All in all you had very good and accurate points in your post and it really puts many things out there.</p>

			<p>Reading this post, I like how they distinguish the two races clearly. It lets us see that stereotyping differentiate us from the rest of the world. This post clearly states what the main topic is about which is stereotyping and it clearly supports the thesis that is mention. I also like how they give us example about what stereotyping is about for those people who don’t know what it means. What I didn’t like about this post is that for all the races out there, they always mention about the African Americans or the Chinese Americans. In the real world, there are other races that have stereotypical issues. Also, since the African Americans and the Chinese Americans are minorities, they are probably easier to be targeted. </p>
<p>I did agree what the author has answer regarding the cultural work of stereotypes. The picture was really straight forward and since the author didn’t take the picture, they observe every detail in the picture.  Comparing the pictures that the author had and the pictures that I had, they both stated the typical stereotypes that people see in this world today. There were hardly any differences in the pictures that I had and what the author had.</p>

			<p>You did make a really good point in the begining of your essay about how no one likes to call the stereotypes in class and it is true.  We do not want to offend any one so everyone in class did stay quite.  Your post was really good and also the pictures that you picked were very moving.  I also liked the comments that you put on your flicker account below the pictures so everyone could read it and be on the same page as you.</p>

			<p>I enjoyed how you brought examples that we were all part of, which was how noone in class would participate in a sensitive subject like race. The other examples I thought were very effective because it brought up stereotypes that we go through everyday. The way the paper was setup was good, because it was organized. Another thing i enjoyed was the last sentence which basically showed me how things have changed from 30, 20, and even 10 years ago, and hopefully keep changing to the right path.</p>

			<p>I found your post overall pretty interesting. I agree with you main point, that stereotypes are usually a negative effect in society, however I felt there were a few weak elements to your post. In the beginning you gave the examples of Asians being good at math and Jews being greedy. I have never heard the generalization of Jews, on the contrary, I have learned that the Jewish population are financially brilliant, however I guess American jelousy could turn that into greediness. I don&#8217;t think that it would be an overstatement to even say American society is greedy overall, but unlike the Jewish population we are over spenders. A second point I found weak in this blog was the possible misinterpretations of the first two photos you used to aid your argument. I&#8217;m not sure what section of the archives they came from, but I felt they could be interpreted in a different way. The first, the boy eating the watermelon wearing no shoes, to me says &#8217;summer.&#8217; Secondly, when I interpret the picture depicting the Chinese, I have learned that Asian populations focus on group achievements rather than the individual. Working closely together they were able to bring each other into wealth and stability, and one could say they could isolate their reliance from the rest of the American society. Therfore when I look at the picture that says the Chinese must go, I see whom ever made it, viewed the Chinese as a threat to America. The last poor element I found was that you say the girl in the ad for the Chinese dresses should not have to wear that dress to sell their product, the dresses sold should speak for the company right? This is true, however, one, the dresses are in their culture. Secondly, maybe in their cultures a reputation alone could sell dresses, but in America, we&#8217;d rather sample the dress before buying, so the ad is merly an advertisement tactic. Okay so even though I&#8217;ve attacked this blog, there were things that I liked about it. I felt as the blog went on it got stronger. The image of Tupac was a good example of a modern stereotype. However, did Tupac pick up on this stereotype and try to fullfill it?</p>

			<p>In this world, especially today, it is hard not to be influenced by stereotypes.  All over the world you see these stereotypes and some of them are true. On the other hand though, some do not come out true. I agree that stereotyping does have a negative effect in society.  Each person takes stereotyping a different way.  In some cases, one can be fine with it and others can get offended, that is why i think we are afraid to say anything in class. I have to agree with what  jburton said, to me a boy eating watermelon with no shoes says &#8220;summer&#8221;.  Why is it assumed that just because he is african-american that he is poor? Overall, I think you had a firm grasp on the topic. It was interesting to read and I agreed with most of it.</p>

			<p>I think its good that you were able to bring certain stereotypes out into the open. The pictures you chose illustrated your points well. Realizing the stereotypes we hold sub-consciously and understanding their bad assumptions with our conscious mind is the first step to doing away with them.  I especially liked your ending. It really brought home the idea of the prevalence of stereotypes in that I knew right away to which you refered.</p>
<p>I do think, however, that some of the comedians/cartoons you mention CONTRIBUTE to stereotypes rather than help ELIMINATE them.</p>

			<p>This is very interesting blog, I really learned a lot. You choose interesting stereotype and also found picture about those stereotype. I think you did very good job of addressing the photo. I agree with you how you said the reason Chinese people wear their traditional cloth because they want to use themselves as advertisement. So they can sell more cloth made by them. I really like last paragraph you related it to stereotypes may place on you.<br />
But you also said black people like eat watermelon and Chinese people work in dry cleaning, which I don’t agree with you. I don’t think your thesis is little too short, if you can make more detail it will make your blog even better.</p>

			<p>I really enjoyed your post.  The best thing that I like was how easy it was to read.  You took four different stereotypes and broke each of them down into four different paragprahs with an introduction and a conclusion.  Breaking each paragraph down into different sections really helped me understand what it was you were trying to say.  I also liked how you talked about the students and the teacher&#8217;s because I agree with that 100 percent.<br />
The only problem I have with your post is your thesis statement.  It&#8217;s not really an arguable statement.  I just feel that if you spent a little more time on that statement and made it arguable, then you post would&#8217;ve been much better.  You have all this good information and examples, but you non-arguable these statement kind of ruins it.</p>

			<p>Your post was a very easy read. I really liked how you categorized the four different stereotypes in your post in to different sections, that made it easy to read and it was very smooth moving from one to the other. The examples you used for your post were good. The stereotypes have lasted over time because I think that there’s no real way of getting rid of them once they’ve been started. Many people will see past them and will be able to think correctly. But there will always be ignorant and rude people in the world that will stereotype certain people and groups. Your ending was very funny and I thought it was a good way to end your post, very appropriate for the topic that you had to write about, good job and good post.</p>

			<p>I think that you did a good job in assessing stereotypes.  The pictures you used definately did get the point you were trying to make across. I thought it was a very good point when you mentioned in class discussions about race and trying not to offend anyone.  I remember one time in high school we had to read a book, I forget what book at the time, and the book was about rascism and had the &#8220;n word&#8221; mentioned many times in it.  We each had to take turns reading.  When it was my turn to read that word was in the section i was to read many times.  The first time i came across the word I looked up at my teacher because we had a few black kids in the class and I didnt want to make anyone angry.  She told me to keep reading and i felt very akward saying the word.</p>
<p>The only thing that i would have added to your post would be to expand stereotypes beyond race for today&#8217;s world.  Yes, race does still play a huge role in stereotypes, however now we have many subcultures such as punk, emo, etc, each based off of stereotypes that they have come to earn.</p>

			<p>I really enjoyed reading your blog and i agree. All races have sterotypes of which people of the same race use to undermine one another. It is important to realize that in todays world people opinionate there sterotypes without realizing that they are doing it. Culture clash is a problem that is still in effect as we speak. When people dont understand a idea or concept they question it and or avoid it. I believe with proper education people can learn to stop generalizing and sterotyping each other. Overall a very good blog post I enjoyed reading it, well done.</p>

			<p>I think that you did a good job on a subject that can get touchy very fast. You handled it in a way  that added some humor into it. I thought that your last sentence was funny and made the situation a little lighter because you made fun of yourself by stating all the stereotypes Hispanics have.<br />
	The only criticism that I have for your post was that some of it was a little confusing.  Such as your introductory paragraph, the last two sentences weren’t so clear. I had to read it a couple of times to understand what you meant. Also when you compared Tupac to the boy with the watermelon didn’t make sense either. But other than those two things I thought your post was interesting and fun to read.</p>

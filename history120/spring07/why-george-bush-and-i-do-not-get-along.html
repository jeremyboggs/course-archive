			<div class="entry">
				<p>So i was reading this <a title="article" href="http://www.myfoxdc.com/myfox/pages/News/Detail?contentId=2381662&amp;version=1&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=TSTY&amp;pageId=3.1.1">article</a> and became very upset and thought I would blog about it.  Now Bush is saying that Iran is supplying all of these weapons to Iraq. I have been calling this for along time. Ever since Bush decieded to talk about the &#8220;Axis of Evil&#8221; (which consists of Iraq, Iran, and North Korea), I have been awaiting the day he brings the next country into the war plans. He has been looking for different ways to anger the people into wanting to attack Iran and now he finally came up with one. Who cares that it is not proven that Iran&#8217;s government is the one providing these weapons?&#8221;I&#8217;m going to do something about it,&#8221; Bush pledged, displaying apparent irritation at being repeatedly asked about mixed administration signals on who was behind the weaponry.</p>
<p>This quote angers me the most. Who cares if the American people want to get involved? No its up to Bush, and Bush alone to decide that. I can only say that I am thankful that the executive branch and the legislative branch are now majority two different political parties. I am also thankful that he is nearing the end of his regime, it is time to get a sane person back in the White House before our foreign relations are damaged beyond repair.</p>

			<p>I guess I&#8217;ll stick up for Bush on this one, even though my knowledge of the subject isn&#8217;t what is should be. I&#8217;m glad Bush is trying to do something and trying to take care of the problems that face the U.S. Bush is in a no win situation as any President would be. If something would happen to the U.S. because of Iran, the question would be raised why something wasn&#8217;t done sooner. I guess everyone is going to have their own opinions and some people are going to support what is going on and some aren&#8217;t. I for one support Bush to the fullest and approve of the decisions that he has made and want to make. I for one hope something is done about the Iran situation. I disagree with what you think about Bush as a President. Even though he hasn&#8217;t been the greatest President in History he finished what his father never did and Clinton always avoided. Now he is paving a starting point for the next President to go from and take care of the problems of the world. I hope another Republican is voted into office, but I have a feeling that might now happen. Its kind of late so I could just not be making any sense at all, but I don&#8217;t care. I&#8217;m just stated what I think.</p>

			<p>So Clinton had great foreign relations and suddenly avoided Iraq? There was nothing wrong with Iraq. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHY WE INVADED IN THE FIRST PLACE???? We invaded because of non existant weapons of mass destruction.  They were not there and now we are in the middle of a civil war that we can do nothing about. I believe that Bush got himself too deep by attempting to not be a lame duck president he made his approval the lowest we have seen in decades. What does that say about his presidency?</p>

			<p>After I read your statement I went to the article you cited, it does not surprise me that it&#8217;s an article from Fox, their news tends to be one sided and often leads to misguided &#8220;rants&#8221;. It would be foolish to think that IF there were in fact weapons of mass desctruction they were not transported to another country given that Iraq was warned we were coming to inspect well before we actually went to inspect. I am not disputing whether or not there were ever weapons of mass destruction, I think that very few people know the entire truth. I think it is easy for people to place blame and find reasons to refute any decision the president makes, and I think it seems a little weak to base so much of a point on something you could not possibly know the real truth to. There are a lot more people that support Bush than most people give credit to. I for one am not a Republican and do not support Bush, however, I do not agree with your argument and find it to be a bit misinformed. I am not saying that you are misinformed, I just think you could have presented your argument better.</p>

			<p>Was it necessary to start this war because we did not find weapons of mass destruction? If everything is so unsure and it is impossible to know the truth then why did we go to war? And why is Bush quoted as wanting to do something about it if it is not proven who is supplying? I think that Bush is too rash and does not think things through before its too late. Most critics, both republicans and democrats alike, agree that the war could have been handled a lot better. There could have been more planning involved if we would have just stopped to think. Others say that if we stopped then they would have hid the weapons. Either way the weapons were hid or do not exist and the majority of the population is now in opposition of how the war was handled. You can criticize my choice of article webpage, but at the same time FOX is known to be conservative. As a person who tries to be well informed I do not read any specific news articles but all. If I were to just stick with one station I would be receiving biased information. What I do know is I received this information from a news station that reported Bush&#8217;s quotes and how he feels about certain topics. I have read similar articles from WashingtonPost.com. I do not agree with the president at all. To improve foreign relations we need to step back and take a look at the conflict we are in and resolve that before we can start conflict with another state. I am sorry if I seem a little heated about this whole debate, I am just unnerved by whole situation. I have been brought up watching politics, both parents involved in the government. It is difficult to watch our country turn into a bully to make a profit. That statement is bold, I know, but honestly step back and take a look at many conflicts we could have been involved in but were not. There are many things going on in the world that we could have tried to stop. Africa, for example, the website I have posted has so many issues that we could have been involved in. Why Iraq? I do not want to go into the whole oil thing I just wish people would ask why more.  I do not think my argument was misinformed but I do agree we do not know all the facts. We can only respond to the facts that have been given to us. In this case there were many facts that were not given to us, mainly by the president. On what grounds did we wage this war. When we inspected and found no weapons and then we went in further and still found no weapons, why didn&#8217;t we stop?<br />

			<p>I agree with most everything you are saying in this response, and I am not going to begin to even try and answer any of the questions you brought up. Even the one or two statements you made that I did not fully agree with I can at least see where you are coming from. This response is much more organized and comes across as being better thought out. Youre completely right about the issues in Africa that we could be involved in, there are obviously huge priority issues, and of course personal vendettas. I respect your apparent knowledge of the situation and that you took the time to correct my misconceptions from your initial post.</p>

			<p>I could not help going on a rant in the beginning. The subject angers me beyond belief. The whole direction of our country scares me a little. Thanks for your comments though, its good to see people educated in politics and our government</p>

			<p>I try to stay away from politics because that is one of the top issues that draw the &#8220;blind&#8221; crowd (those that steadfast in their views even if they are proven wrong). In turn, I am probably not the most informed on the subject. But when I saw this article, I had to say something, even if it is just a joke. Here is the picture in the news article in question with my own caption.</p>
<p>&#8220;I swear, it was this big!&#8221;</p>
<p>Anyway, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if we were led into another &#8220;conflict&#8221; in the middle east. Hopefully he won&#8217;t with only two years left in his presidency.<br />
At this point, I don&#8217;t think it will matter what our government does, because the country is so polarized that anything done, or even not done, is disapproved. Excuse my pessimism, but this country is doomed if it doesn&#8217;t listen to what the people want.</p>

			<p>Just so you all know, FOX news(not like they are that credible or anything) says that Iran is suspected now of  having people in the U.S that are investigating how to bomb New York&#8217;s subways and bridges. I feel as if this proves my point a little further.</p>

				<p>        “They came, they saw, they conquered, and now the Americans dominate the world like no nation before.” This sentiment taken from Guardian Magazine expresses how many people feel about the modern United States. The Roman Empire was the superpower of its era, and now the U.S. has willingly taken over its reins. Comparisons with the former empire can extend to military power, government, citizenships, imperialism, and many other areas. One undeniable imitation of the Roman Empire can be seen throughout Washington D.C.. <strong>Numerous buildings, monuments, and statues were built, around the capitol, with a Roman architectural style to imitate the power and prestige of former world power.</strong>       </p>
<p>       History portrays Roman culture as a very sophisticated nation. In school, we are taught about towering figures in history, like Augustus, Nero, and Marcus Aurelius. In literature, Shakespeare immortalizes the best know leader of the Roman Empire, in the play Julius Caesar. History will forever have Rome be synonymous with greatness. While visiting the U.S capitol, it is impossible to not see the towering pillars, large domed buildings, and statues canonizing American figures. I believe, in an attempt imitate the Roman Empire, the United States used a Roman designed architecture to be seen as great. For history to remember the U.S. in a positive light, it must attempt to be seen as elite, and embracing an aspect of the Roman Empire into our culture, it helps perpetuate that sense of greatness. </p>
<p>       The buildings and monuments throughout D.C. are not considered one distinct architectural style. However, many of the buildings that imitate Roman culture are very similar to a style called Beaux-Arts. It can be characterized by two distinct designs: “Symmetry and hierarchy of spaces, from “noble spaces”—grand entrances and staircases—to utilitarian ones.” There have been some adaptations to the style, but it has remained consistent since its creation in Paris, during the 17th century. The style naturally conveys sensations of being elite, which helps the U.S. be seen as a great nation.</p>
<p>	The First monument I choose to look at was the Jefferson Memorial. Of the three structures I choose, I realized that it looked most like classic Roman and Greek Temples. The monument is also interesting because of its location. Located in Washington D.C West Potomac Park, near the shore of the Potomac River Tidal Basin, it suggests how important roman architecture is to the U.S.. Created during the early 20th century, the monument could have been built using a more modern design, but instead, it continued a tradition of building monuments like Roman temples. The circular pillars, dome on top, and marble bricks are all part of classical Roman structures. With further exploration I learned, the designer of the monument, John Russell Pope, used the Beaux-Arts style.  Thomas Jefferson, our third president, was also fascinated with Roman architecture and used the style to design Monticello and the Rotunda after the Pantheon of Rome. </p>
<p>        The Lincoln Monument was the second I realized looked very similar to the classic examples of Roman architecture.  After researching the structure, I found out it was not designed in the Beaux-Arts style, but it contained the symmetric and “higher spaces” design functions. One of the most famous locations in the National Mall, I thought that it was very important and consistent that the monument look similar to the Roman architecture. All of the monuments were designed with specific purposes and functions. I believe the purpose behind creating the Lincoln Memorial, was to be a symbol of power and prestige. Abraham Lincoln was one of the most progressive presidents to ever serve in off. He created a movement that began to change the way slavery was looked at in the United. States. Every aspect of the monument continues the theme of power and prestige. </p>
<p>        The last monument I looked at, the District of Columbia War Memorial, I found by accident. The memorial commemorates the citizens of the District of Columbia who served in World War I. The memorial is located in West Potomac Park slightly off of Independence Avenue in a grove of trees.  The design is very similar to both the Lincoln and Jefferson monuments, with giant pillars, “higher spaces”, and Symmetry. I think of the three monuments, this one was the most important. Very few people have every heard of the memorial or even know where it is located. Nevertheless, the memorial still adhered to the classic Roman style. Since the memorial commemorates the soldiers from D.C. who faugh in World War I, I thought it was closest to the military battles fought by the Roman Empire. Just as gladiators and commanders were glorified in Roman times, the D.C. War Memorial commemorates the soldiers who fought for us. </p>
<p>        Many people dispute the assumption that the United States and the Roman Empire are similar. Regardless of the debate, looking at the structure of the buildings in D.C., suggests the U.S. is trying to emulate the former world power. The United States wants to be seen as a great nation, and what better way to be seen as great, than imitate the Roman Empire. A famous quote by Charles Caleb Colton explains best the United States’ actions best; “Imitation is the sincerest of flattery.” </p>

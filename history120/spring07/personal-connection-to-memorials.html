				<p>Touring the National Mall was something I have always wanted to do (being a history major and just generally loving to visit museums and the like), so I was very excited when we were assigned to do this project. I expected to find memorials, plain and simply. However, as I moved from one to another, I realized that you cannot help but feel different emotions. Walking through and around the monuments, the most prominent feature I noticed about each was the intention to make you feel personally connected to each place and story. Most notably, the fact that at each of the monuments I chose, the Vietnam War Memorial, the World War II Memorial, and the Lincoln Memorial, seeing your reflection was specifically used in different ways. <strong>Designers of each of the monuments includes an aspect of reflection in order to make the viewers feel personally connected to what the monument represents.</strong></p>
<p>The Vietnam War Memorial is one of the younger memorials, constructed in 1982. It was designed by Maya Ying Lin and consists of two black, granite walls. This specific type of granite was chosen because of its reflective quality. While I was standing amongst all the people who were visiting the memorial that day, I was amazed by the utter silence. I felt a sense of deep respect and I believe everyone who was looking at the wall was feeling very similar. I think this memorial comes across as, not necessiarly anti-war, but there is more of a feeling of loss here than at some other memorials, most likely because you can corralate the names to actual people and their families. Standing in front of the Vietnam War Memorial, you can understand why the designer felt it was so important for the viewer to be able to see themselves among all the names. While looking at your own reflection, not only does it cause you to think about all these men that gave their lives, but also makes you feel as though the past and present are undenialbly connected to one another. This feeling is just as prevalent when you take the time to look at each of the items left by family and friends under the wall. It is obvious to any that the Vietnam War has and continues to affect thousands of people, and the reflective nature of the granite helps to show this.</p>
<p>While the Vietnam War Memorial provides a somber atmosphere, there is of course a memorial that brings out a happy, carefree feeling. The National World War II Memorial, while still a war memorial, evokes something completely different than the Vietnam War Memorial. The World War II Memorial is the youngest on the mall, just having been completed in 2004. Designed by Friedrich St. Florian, the memorial is a circluar structure with 56 pillars, each with the states and territories of the United States at the time of World War II. The middle holds a huge fountain pool, with the fountains shooting high into the air. Here, reflecting is mostly done in a celebratory manner. Children are running around and the area is much louder, with people talking and laughing, than at any other memorial. Why this memorial is depicted this way is a bit unanswered. Perhaps it is because of the portrayed success and victory of good triumphing evil throughout World War II. Perhaps because it was built so recently, events like the war in Iraq were beginning to loose favor and this could remind people of the feeling of winning a war. I believe it is a bit of a combination of both, and I&#8217;m sure other things depending upon who is interpreting the memorial. Whatever the reason for the difference in design style, I think the atmosphere is good and needed, especially if you have already visited the more somber memorials.</p>
<p>Leaving the World War II Memorial, you automatically come upon the Reflecting Pool, which lies between the World War II Memorial and the Lincoln Memorial. The Reflecting Pool is not really a memorial of any sort, but definitely has its own atmosphere and connects up to the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. As it name implies, this is a place where many people sit and have lunch or just some peace and quiet. It is shallow, only about 3 feet deep, and has a natural calming effect. Walking from the World War II Memorial, this calm is needed as you approach the Lincoln Memorial. Approaching the Lincoln Memorial is a sight in itself. It was designed by Henry Bacon to mimic a Greek Doric temple, for example the Parthenon. Climbing up the steps, you can&#8217;t immediate see the huge statue of Abraham Lincoln. However, one you walk in past the columns, the first time you see the statue, it is a bit breathtaking. The statue sits 19 feet tall and immediately causes you to feel a sense of authority. Looking up at the huge man, instead of feeling the need to relate yourself directly to the people or situation, you simply marvel at the wonderful reputation this man must have had to deserve something so grand. On the walls are two of his most well known speeches, the Gettysburg Address and his second inaugural address. Looking at these, especially the Gettysburg Address, you get the sense of how important these were in his time as president. While it may not be a personal reflection, the Lincoln Memorial still evokes certain emotions that cause a personal connection and strong apprecation to a great president.</p>
<p>While each memorial definitely brings out three different emotions, each causes the viewers to reflect on the memorial and look inward. If you are open and receptive to the emotional aspect of the memorials, anyone can find a personal connection to each monument, whether you and your family has been directly affected by any of the events or historical figures. I believe in order to appreciate history and learn from it, we MUST feel personally connected to events that have happened in our country&#8217;s past. Taking a tour of war cites like the World War II Memorial and the Vietnam Memorial can show you both sides to a war. The Lincoln Memorial can give you a sense that many great people have led our nation to allow it to become something great and all hope is not lost (if you so happen to feel that way with current issues). Each memorial gives a new, different reflection than the next and it is important to take the time to investigate each of these.</p>

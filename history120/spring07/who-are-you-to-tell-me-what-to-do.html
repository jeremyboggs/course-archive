			<div class="entry">
				<p>Over the past few years, the controversial topic of the confederate flag has become more and more prevalent. For some the symbol represents southern pride, heritage of the confederacy along with many other positive notions. For others the flag is a symbol of hate and opression. In a country where the citizens are from a multitude of nationalities and backgrounds, your going to come to some point in time where two people disagree. <strong>The flying of the confederate flag should be a states right to choose rather than being controlled by the government. </strong></p>
<p>In this article <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/11/01/elec04.prez.dean.confederate.flag/">here,</a> Howard Dean struck high controversey by stating that he wants the support of those that drive pickup trucks and rock the ol&#8217; stars and bars. While this attempt to rally support from southern crowd earned him a standing ovation from supporters, other Democratic canidates were irrate and disgusted. Dean, who has made these types of statements on more than one occasion, believed that this statement would sway the southerners who have been voting republican, to change their mind and support Dean.</p>
<p>A more recent <a href="http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=19494">article,</a> entais Hillary Clintion stating that the south, may be just a little too southern. According to Hillary, it is apparently Un-American to be southern and take pride in a flag which your fore fathers flew as they went in to battle. These days children are being expelled from their schools for wearing shirts that carry the symbol so proudly and it affects no only the children that were ousted, but those that view the flag as hateful.</p>
<p>In a society where freedom and rights are glorified, its funny that we are trying to control people still. The flying of a historical flag, should be someones own personal choice, not necessairly the states. If a state would like to fly the flag above their capital then it should be up to their citizens to choose. This would be the &#8220;democratic&#8221; way to approach the situation. Yet we let symbolism take charge of our opinions and in turn we would all like to everyone else to agree with the way we percieve things. WAKE UP! Thats not how life works, and if it was, I&#8217;d be a millionaire that practices polygamy</p>
<p>While it is belived that we should stand united under one flag, which we do in most cases with the American Flag, who are we to say what an individual can and cannot display. The symbol of the Confederate flag will always hold certain value to some, while it may be viewed in a completely different light by others. It really comes down to a matter of personal opinion, and who are we to tell someone else what to think and how to act. Sounds a little like we are trying to play a game of who wants to be a communist.</p>

			<p>&#8220;The symbol of the Confederate flag will always hold certain value to some, while it may be viewed in a completely different light by others.&#8221; I totally agree with this. You are right, people should have a say in what they individually want to do. Though not when it comes to something as controversial as the Confederate flag. With this, you are going to start more riots, more fights and more controversy. Allowing people to display it will cause an uproar and a cycle that will never end. We need to get past slavery and anything that had to do with slavery to move forward. With issues like this, the governemnt needs to step in and take action. </p>
<p>Your post was interesting and I enjoyed it. You added in some humor every once in awhile that really held my attention and made me continue reading. I think that you should have added direct quotes from your sources to really exemplify your points. It would have made your arguements more clearer. Good post!</p>

			<p>I live in New Jersey, the &#8220;North&#8221; if you will, so I dont really see to many Confederate flags.  The ones I do see are those that are owned by my friends who live on farms.  Now at first I defiantely thought they were rascist because of this flag until I just asked them why they flew it.  They said for Southern pride and the family was really interested in the history of the Civil War.  Because of this, I agree that people should have the choice to fly the flag or display the flag on clothing or whatever they choose to do.  Unfortunately, yes this a controvertial flag, but I feel that it is an extremely important part in American History.  To ban this flag isn&#8217;t quite erasing the memory of the Confederacy, but it is greatly undermining it.</p>
<p>I really like the line in your post, &#8220;Yet we let symbolism take charge of our opinions and in turn we would all like to everyone else to agree with the way we percieve things.&#8221;  I find this to be very true.  I listen to metal and because of this many of my cd&#8217;s have a pentagram on them.  Many times I have let people look at my cd&#8217;s and been called a Satan worshiper when they dont know all the meanings of this symbol.  One meaning is the five bodily senses, another is Satan but only in the modern times, and this symbol used to be used by the Catholics centuries ago.  When I try to explain this to people they just say I&#8217;m going to hell.</p>
<p>The only thing about your post that I didn&#8217;t really like was the humor.  Yes it was funny but it didn&#8217;t really seem appropriate.</p>

			<p>I am glad that someone took the other side of the debate on the confederate flag, going against the mentality of &#8220;If it offends anybody, we have to scrap it.&#8221; I also think that it shouldn&#8217;t be left up to the US government to flat out allow or ban this flag, I think it should be taken case by case. (I.E. Yes it can be on your bumper, and no it probably shouldn&#8217;t be hung above a state capital building)Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t seem like you represented both sides well, one of the points of this assignment. Overall, good post though.</p>

			<p>I think your post is well written and well supported also. The argument you are trying to make about it should be a right whether or not to fly the confederate flag is well supported and the point you make on why we should be allowed to fly it is good. Even though I don&#8217;t agree with the flying of the confederate flag, I do think that what you are saying makes sense too. I think so many people think about the flag in the civil war and what the war was fought over and think that is the meaning of it today, when thats not the case. &#8220;For some the symbol represents southern pride, heritage of the confederacy along with many other positive notions.&#8221; That is a good sentence and true. If we stop looking at the negative in the flag then we wouldn&#8217;t have a problem with the flag and I thought you did a good job of writing why it should be a choice we have. </p>
<p>I thought this was a good article and while I liked the sources you provided links to, I would of liked you to provide some thoughts about the situation by people that were not in office. I know it might of been hard to find, but maybe find some interviews with people on them telling the meaning of the flag to them and why they fly it or wear shirts with it on it.</p>

			<p>I think it was a smart move in choosing political candidates as examples showing the controversy because a wide range of people know of them.  Also, I think you did a pretty good job giving a summary of what the controversy was about. Yet I still think you could have gone into more detail.</p>
<p>The assignment sheet could not have been more clearly stated, yet it still failed to address why the topic is controversial. Your thesis should have been something like, “The flying of the confederate flag is controversial because it is a symbol of both heritage and oppression.  Also, I don’t think it was a good move to say, “wake up!”. It may offend the readers because it makes it seem like they are the ones who are doing wrong. </p>
<p>Overall I think you did a good job, and I definitely agree with you that the people state of Georgia should be the ones who make the ultimate decision of whether they fly the confederate flag as their state flag.</p>

			<p>I strongly agree with your post, and you have given some very good examples to show support for your opinions.  Their were a few grammatical errors in your post but nothing serious.  The controversial issue of weather or not people should be allowed to fly the confederate flag is an argument that has gone on for far too long.  People don&#8217;t like what the Confederate flag stands for because of slavery and the civil war, but consider this for one minute.  People do not usually have a problem with Japanese people flying their flag even though they attacked us unprovoked during World War II and caused massive amounts of American casualties throughout the war.</p>

			<p>I enjoyed reading this post. Even though I agree with you that everyone has his right to his individual preference of something they represent. This all depends on the intention and the reason. Because knowing what people&#8217;s intentions are hard to figure out I think that it represesnting the Confederate flag should be banned, only to prevent tension and separation between Americans. </p>
<p>It was a well written post and had many good point, and humor in your paper kept me reading. but there were gramatical mistakes. Overall well organized paper.</p>

			<p>Your blog is very well written, however I believe that your arguement is a strawman.  First, I should state that I agree with your thesis, but the arguement you give to the other side of the issue is grossly overstated.  In your post you ask &#8220;who are we to say what an individual can and cannot display&#8221;, it would be unconstitutional to ban an individual from displaying a flag and I have never heard anyone seriously consider the idea.</p>
<p>You make a good point about a states right to fly the stars and bars if its citizens elect officials who support it, no matter how ignorant and inconsiderate it is.</p>

			<p>Your post is written well and your thesis is clear. You presented your topic well and helped me to understand the controversy surrounding confederate flag. You summarized and critiqued both editorial accurately. You did a good job explaining why displaying confederate flag should be a personal decision. However, I disagree with it. I think confederate flag should be banned even if this is a free democratic country. Slavery was the one of the major issues that caused Civil War, and it also was the origin of confederate flag. As long as flag can be symbol of oppression and racism, it should be banned.</p>

			<p>I really liked your thesis.  I totally agree with you that the states should have the right to chose whether or not the Confederate flag should be hung.  This makes sense, because the public should have a chance to speak out knowing that a decision will be made.  The government making a decision will stir up more controversy towards the Confederate flag still being used.</p>
<p>Your post was good, and you make some insightful statements.  However, your conclusion paragraph should have been more in depth with the arguments.  Your post was lacking in description, but you made some good points in paragraph 4.  You also had a few grammatical errors in your blog.</p>

			<p>Well written post about how the Confederate flag is still a controversial piece of our history.  I agree with your method of deciding whether or not to have the Confederate flag flown in a state or not.  Leave it up to the citizens of the state and the majority decides if the flag stays or goes.  I liked how you showed two politicians taking this issue and using it to their advantage.  It&#8217;s not just politicians, Steve Spurrier of South Carolina University also had a run in with the Confederate flag down by where he coaches football.  This just shows that this &#8220;problem&#8221; is everywhere and there needs to be a new way to solve.  A few more examples would have helped, and there were a few spelling errors.</p>

			<p>I really enjoyed reading your post. I think you did a great job using examples of politicans as your support. While I might not necessarily agree with him, I admire that Howard Dean will go out and make somewhat controversial statements on what he believes in, rather than just take the middle ground as many politicans do. Also, you can really tell that you believe in what your writing about which adds a lot to the post. When you say, &#8220;WAKE UP! Thats not how life works, and if it was, I’d be a millionaire that practices polygamy&#8221;, it adds humor to your post as well as showing you have a strong opinion. I also think you supported your thesis well, however you could have used a couple more examples.</p>
<p>However, I just can&#8217;t help but disagree with you about states being able to fly the flag at their capitals. I&#8217;m from Virginia, and I&#8217;ve seen both sides of this issue. While person choice to wear something or fly something shouldn&#8217;t be hendered, I believe states that choose to fly the flag are showing outright disrespect to the rest of the nation. Also when you say, &#8220;For some the symbol represents southern pride, heritage of the confederacy along with many other positive notions. For others the flag is a symbol of hate and opression&#8221;, this really drives home my point. While I no doubtedly believe that some want to have this flag to honor their ancestors, there is also the percentage of people who do it for purely racial discrimination, and I have witnessed this on many occasions.</p>
<p>Overall, I think your post was well written and I really enjoyed reading it.</p>

			<p>Good post! What I like about this post is that they included from the editorials that they were required to read. This example sentence from the editorial states ““The symbol of the Confederate flag will always hold certain value to some, while it may be viewed in a completely different light by others.” When I read this, I totally agree with this statement. In my point of view I understand that it means differently to different people. It has a lot of meaning if you lived during the time or if you have any close relatives that lived during that time. What I didn’t like about this post is that it just had little grammatical errors. Overall, it was an interesting post. When I read this post, I understood the points where the post author was trying to reach. They included examples form the editorial which helped a lot. The argument that you are trying to prove was clear and well supported by the examples that you have shown.</p>

			<p>I fell in love with your post. I completely agree. Being from the south, I see confederate flags all over the place, it is normal. It is not the symbol of racism that many people think, it is our symbol of pride that we still have even though we lost the war. I used to hate the south and I used to hate seeing the flag flying everywhere back home, but you dont know what you have until it&#8217;s gone. This is just another issue about State&#8217;s Rights!!! Awesome post!!!</p>

			<p>I fully agree with you and your thesis. It should be a person&#8217;s own personal choice. It would be un-democratic to say that you cannot display a confederate flag. People have the right to say and act as they want. People have different reasons for flying a confederate flag. Perhaps a relative of theirs fought in the civil war and they are proud of that. But also the confederate flag is more a symbol of southern pride. Even though they lost, they still have pride that they fought.  </p>
<p>The opening of your post was great, and your thesis is strong and direct. The paragraph on Howard Dean was confusing. I had no idea what happend other than the southerners supported him. The Hilary Clinton article though got me envolved in the post and argument. I disagree with her completely saying, &#8220;it is&#8230;Un-American to be southern and take pride in a flag which your fore fathers flew as they went in to battle.&#8221; One can and should be proud of their relatives fighting and maybe even dieing fighting for their pride. It is not racist to be proud of your relatives. I love how your feelings and personality are prevelent in the post. You can really see that it gets you a little &#8220;fired up.&#8221; </p>
<p>The only thing wrong with your post is a few gramatical errors that I had to figure out for myself. For example, &#8220;we would all like to everyone else to agree with the way we percieve things.&#8221; Other than that, it was interesting and got me &#8220;excited.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Race has been the most divisive issues since the beginning of history. Understanding what to do and figuring out the best way to implement solutions is far more difficult than it seems. The confederate flag has been a difficult issue for generations. I think you did a very good job at giving your opinion. I think by taking such a balanced approach to your thesis gave you a sense of credibility and understanding. </p>
<p>The problem I saw with you post was the thesis. You suggest that it should be the states right to fly the confederate flag or not. The issues arise with the amount of people in a state. Who exactly in the state should determine if the flag should be allowed? A large number of people, especially minorities, do not believe the flag should be on public buildings or the state flag. Another large group of people should view the flag as a symbol of their heritage. The only effective way to deal with this issue is to find a compromise.</p>

			<p>I felt that this was a very logical well written post. I agree that at all times in life you are going to find people who disagree and offend each other. One of the strongest elements of this post, I believe, was when you talked about the &#8220;democratic&#8221; thing to do. I feel like the government is always dictating what rights we should hold, and those of which we are denied. I do not believe flying a confederate flag is something we should be denied. This country is not going to regress to slavery and hatred because someone decided to display a part of history. </p>
<p>One element I felt was weak of this post was support of your argument. To make your argument stronger you could have gave some examples of things in society that are flat out &#8216;reserved&#8217; for the African American population that some people may be offended by, like BET, Black Entertainment, or FUBU, for us by us.</p>

I also believe however that something with this kind of historical significance is not something that you can simply ignore, or try to forget about.</p>

			<p>If in most cases we stand united under one flag, the American one then why would we want a flag that breaks everything we&#8217;ve worked for and seperates us?? If a person wants to enjoy their confederate flag and not offend people they should do it on their own private time with people that agree with them.</p>

			<p>i think you are right on your post because it is that one persons choice to display the flag or not.  The goverment should not tell us what we can do and what we can&#8217;t do then would classify our government as a communist govermnent.

I agree with your points, but I feel like you didn&#8217;t really explain the controversy over the Confederate flag. Yeah, kids are getting kicked out of school and you mentioned briefly how it symbolizes hate and oppression, but I think you should have gone more in depth about it.</p>

			<p>I think the strong points of your post were the political campaigns that you used, good job on that. I agree with you that it is a person&#8217;s own choice if they want to display the flag or not display it. Good job on the post I think you did a very good job on it.</p>

			<p>The flag represents being united. Meaning all the citizens of the country sulute one flag. In this case the American flag, which represents everything we stand for as a country, as a whole. The confederate flag holds a meaning to many southern states who celebrate it for the history of there ancestors. I feel it should not be looked down upon as long as people see the confederate flag as representive of there past ancestors. Although on the other hand it should be a crime to waive the flag around if you do it out of hate or think it represents slavery. In this case the confederate flag was defeated to uphold the law and get rid of slavery. I do not think everybody in the south is raciest, however I can bet there are many people who would not to see forigners or any other colored people around.</p>

			<p>Great Post! I&#8217;d never heard that Howard Dean quote, that was funny, it&#8217;s obvious he was trying to get some more votes. I believe individuals should have the right to use the flag in whatever manner they choose, however I believe that states should ban them at public places, and institutions. I know their is alot of heritage involved with the flag, but out of respect for the African-Americans who see this as a constant reminder of what their ancestors went through, states should show some sensitivity to them. This is a tough issue and i thought you did a good job in your arguments.</p>

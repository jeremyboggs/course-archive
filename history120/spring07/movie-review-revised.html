				<p>A huge part of what history is is finding clues and piecing them together. Especially difficult is figuring out pieces of history from hundreds of years ago. There are always hints that lead to another and lead to another before any real important facts are discovered. <strong><u>National Treasure</u> is a historical puzzle because it is several clues that are pieced together to get to the end of a treasure hunt.</strong> Ben Gates is a historical analyst who goes on a journey to piece together a mystery that has been passed down throughout his family for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>The overall goal of this movie is to tell the story of a hunt for a treasure that’s worth is inconceivable to even think of. In <u>National Treasure</u>, Ben Gates goes on a quest to find a hidden treasure that was buried somewhere underneath ‘The Charlotte’ by the group the Masons. He pieces together the clues that have been passed down through his family since the 1800’s. The first clue is that “it lies beneath The Charlotte.” They are then brought to a clue that is on the back of the Declaration of Independence, which next brings them to the Liberty Bell in New Jersey. They finally find the large treasure underneath a church in a hidden underground room. To make the search even harder, millionaire Ian Howe is trying to beat them to the treasure to claim as his own, even if it means killing anyone that gets in his way.</p>
<p>The writers of this movie did a great job at twisting our everyday American symbols, (the liberty bell, the Declaration of Independence, American currency), into being clues for the movie. One set of clues I found most interesting was the numbers on the back of the Declaration of Independence that linked with the Silence Dogood letters. The numbers were actually a key to decode a secret message from a group of letters Benjamin Franklin wrote to a newspaper under the name of Silence Dogood. The message, &#8220;The vision to see the treasured past, comes as the timely shadow crosses in front of the house of Pass and Stow,” leads them to the Liberty bell.<br />
            The story behind the hidden treasure is very interesting.  The treasure was passed to different nationalities of people, including the Egyptians and Romans, for thousands of years. Its value increased every time it was stolen and taken to a new country. When the Masons got a hold of it, they decided to burry the treasure because they didn’t believe that any man could handle that amount of wealth, not even a king. They left behind a bunch of clues that would lead to the treasure so that it would not be completely forgotten.</p>
<p> I think that this movie could help kids find history even more fascinating than it already is. If an adult like me found this movie to be mesmerizing, I know a kid would probably find it even better. With its rating of PG and being created by  Disney, I think it was intended for all ages and to be a movie to make anyone spellbound by history like so many of us were in our younger age.</p>
<p>            This movie is very much historical fiction; while there are many real historical facts and symbols, I honestly don’t believe that there is a map made of these symbols that lead to a treasure. Although they bent the truth a lot in different scenes, I think they did it for good reasons which led the viewers to think, “what if this really was true.” I googled some of the “facts” from the movie to see if they were actually true, and some of the facts really were facts. One of the clues was a group of letters written by Silence Dogood, in reality she really was the first pseudonym that Benjamin Franklin created. It was impressive how Gates was able to piece together long forgotten clues to find the treasure that our founding fathers had buried so long ago. It seemed as though this was going to be a never ending puzzle, but in the end was finally solved and like all Disney movies, had a happy ending.</p>

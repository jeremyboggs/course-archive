				<small>May 10th, 2007 <!-- by nkelly4 --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The monuments that I chose for the National Mall photo essay were the Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, and the Jefferson Memorial. I chose these because of the presidential theme, and their close proximity to one another. <strong>The three monuments I chose were purposefully positioned in a symmetrical way to each other, in order to create an underlying theme of connection between them</strong>.  For instance, the Lincoln Memorial is directly west of the Washington monument, and the Jefferson memorial is located directly south of it. It seems that this was set up this way, with the Washington Monument being the centerpiece of it all.  The monuments/memorials were set up in order to remember these presidents who greatly contributed to our country’s current position.</p>
<p>The Washington Monument took 40 years to complete its original construction due to a lack of funds. The project was interrupted by the Civil War. The monument was authorized by Congress in 1833, and was not completely finished until 1884 (<a href="http://www.watch.pair.com/">www.watch.pair.com</a>). It is one of tallest masonry structures and stands 555 feet, and is made up of marble, granite, and sandstone. At the time it was the world’s tallest structure displaying our nation’s great appreciation for George Washington. The location of the Washington monument symbolizes the importance of George Washington, and this monument is one of the most recognizable structures in the world. The Washington monument was strategically placed in the center of the National Mall, and is elevated on higher ground so the monument can be seen from basically all parts of Washington D.C., and surrounding areas. The fact that the Washington monument by law must be the tallest structure in D.C. solidifies its importance, and shows great respect towards the monument. The Washington Monument is a clear symbol of our country’s 1<sup>st</sup> great leader.</p>
<p>Robert Mills, the architect behind the project designed the monument with a blend of Greek, Babylonian and Egyptian architecture. I believe the monument has a religious undertone to it. The fact that the there is a pyramid at the top which points to the sky could be a deliberate symbol of a divine structure. The structure also sits alone on an elevated hill, in a sense looking down on D.C., and watching over D.C., I also see this as another symbol of the Washington monument being the heart of D.C., and to respect George Washington for being our country’s 1<sup>st</sup> leader. The structure is dominating in comparison to other memorials and structures in the District. When outside of the monument you can’t help but feel small, when looking up at the structure you can feel the power of it as it towers over you.  It was designed to be our national structure that would represent our country, which is evident by the 50 flags surrounding the monument representing each state. The official monument of Washington has the shape of an Egyptian obelisk, and I found out that at the top of the cap of the monument the two words “Laus Deo” exist, which in Latin means Praise be to God. These words are placed on top of D.C.’s highest structure in the most powerful city in the world. Another interesting fact is that the Jefferson memorial is to the south, the Capital to the East, and the Lincoln memorial is to the west, which could resemble a cross. This is another sign that possibly these monuments had a religious undertone to them and that there is a reference to God. This makes sense because our country was founded on a Judeo-Christian theology.</p>
<p>The Lincoln Memorial, which was built on the National Mall was architecturally designed by Henry Bacon, and was opened to the public in 1922. The memorial is similarly designed to a Greek Doric temple. It has 36 columns, which represented the 36 states at the time of Lincoln’s death. The Lincoln memorial was dedicated in 1922 to honor President Lincoln. The statue is surrounded by engraved readings of the Gettysburg address. The Lincoln Memorial is shaped like the Parthenon. The statue of Lincoln is 12 ft high and has Lincoln positioned so that he is staring towards the White House. Lincoln is sitting down in a contemplative state. The Lincoln memorial has an opening in the North and South parts of the memorial which could symbolize the Civil War, with Lincoln in the middle, trying to bring our country together at the time. One of the noticeable inscriptions in the memorial was<em> “ this temple, as in the hearts of the people for whom he saved the Union, the memory of Abraham Lincoln is enshrined forever”. </em></p>
<p>The Jefferson Memorial is located on the Tidal Basin and was finished in 1943. The white marble building was designed by John Russell Pope, and is a circular structure with a domed ceiling, surrounded by 26 columns, and a 19 ft. statue of Jefferson. It is a classical design modeled after Jefferson’s design of the Rotunda of the University of Virginia, which Jefferson based on the Pantheon in Rome (google.com) The 26 ionic columns symbolize the 26 states in the Union at the end of Jefferson’s terms as president. The triangular section over the entrance to the memorial represents the 5-man committee assigned by the Continental Congress to draft the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson is posed as if he was addressing the Continental Congress, and in his left hand he holds a copy of the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson looks out from the interior of the memorial towards the White House. There is also various writings of Jefferson carved along the interior walls of the memorial. Jefferson’s famous quote in the memorial is “<em>I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man”.</em></p>
<p>Some of the similarities I noticed in the monuments were obviously the classic Greek/Roman designs of the monuments. Although I love the look of all the monuments/memorials, I wondered why they wouldn’t have had a more modern look to them. Also, the columns representing the number of states that were present during the president’s tenure was interesting. All of the memorials seem to be juxtaposed in order to get the feel that they are all connected, which makes the memorials more powerful. The fact that they all surround the Washington monument symbolizes that George Washington was the 1<sup>st</sup> leader of this country but that Jefferson and Lincoln both followed in his footsteps and made a huge impact on the development of the U.S. I still believe that the monuments were placed strategically to represent a cross, symbolizing our nation’s belief in God. I think that would be silly if in fact this was the case, but I wouldn’t be surprised because of the importance placed on Religion.</p>

					<p>The monuments and memorials of Washington DC tell a large story of our country’s past. As I visited the many memorials our city has I realized, almost all of our memorials are about war. <strong>These memorials symbolize the millions who have fought for our country so that their memory will live on.</strong> The memorials I chose were the Lincoln Memorial, Korean War Memorial, and the Roosevelt Memorial. These three I feel represent our country during some very important and hard times it has gone through. My theme for this project is obvious, but fits best. War and fighting, has been a reoccurring action in our country since it was founded. I believe that the majority of the wars we have fought have been for a good reason. The three memorials I chose symbolize how hard we fought for the freedoms we achieved and kept alive, by fighting in these wars. The Roosevelt Memorial doesn’t directly represent war, but it represents the hard times before World War Two and has quotes about Roosevelt’s feelings on war. It shows the agony our people went through during the Great Depression. It also praises Roosevelt for the extreme difficulties he went through while leading our country from a wheelchair. The Lincoln Memorial symbolizes what a great leader Abraham Lincoln was to be able to save the union and keep our country from falling apart. While doing that he was also able to emancipate the slaves. The Korean War Memorial observes the men who fought to protect democracy from being taken over by communism. It honors our men who helped keep communist North Korea out of South Korea. Our national memorials are here to honor our fellow Americans who bravely fought to make our country what it is today.</p>

					<p>This may be one of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMH0bHeiRNg">funniest / coolest</a> guys to ever live. His depictions of classic to modern dance styles makes you chuckle to yourself a little bit. If any of you have ever done any of these dances, you know that little chuckle I&#8217;m talking about. This clip emphasizes not only the different styles of dance, but also the music and attitude that went with the time. <strong>If history is bound to repeat itself, which I belive it does, we will see some of these moves come back in a crazy RAGE!</strong></p>
<p>Just think about it. When we were kids back in the late 80&#8217;s break dancing was at an all time record high. It was what everyone did. Then it kind of dyed off and Rock was the king of dance with crazy mosh pits and people flailing around like crazy. Now days its hip hop, with its bump and grind, and hip hop dance moves, but you still see some resemblance from some of the dance steps. Crip Walking looks an awful lot like a break dancers top rock, just with a little bit more style and some modern day enhancements. Hip Hop dances are similar to moves you would have only done at the disco, while rockin&#8217; your favorite pair of bell bottoms, just more speed and a little bit more pep to your step. Even moves like the chicken dance are still in use today at things like weddings. I know I&#8217;ve flapped the wings recently.<br />
It&#8217;s strange to think that in the short time that we have experienced in this world, how much has changed and evolved. I mean back in the day New Kids on the Block Jeans were the coolest thing along with the Zack Morris haircut. If you had those two super attributes of the time, man you were the coolest cat on the block. I can&#8217;t wait for the return of break dancing, I&#8217;ve even got an old school pair of white adidas for when the day comes.</p>

					<p>Monuments are designed in order to remember an important person or event. They show significance or importance. Washington is a city built around monuments. Because of its importance as a city, it is the capitol of country and has is leading world power, it carries even more meaning and memories. The wars, marches, and elections all have significant connection to Washington D.C. <strong>The National Mall in Washington DC is an important landmark beacuse it carries some of the most influential monuments in American history.</strong> This piece of land that is stretched out from the capitol until the Washington Monument is full of memorials that represent important dates and people in the United States history.</p>
<p>The first memorial I visited was the Washington Monument. The reason I choose to visit this memorial was because I felt it was one of the most famous landmarks in Washington DC. Its notables height helps attract many visitors. At the date of its completed construction it was announced to be the tallest structures in the world. Today, although it is not the tallest, it remains to be on the tallest stonework structures. Its structure also attracts curiosity. People when passing by always want to know what is going on around and inside it. To add to this, this structure is memorial for the first president of the United States. This makes it one of the most important memorials in the Washington DC area. For these reasons I decided the Washington Monument was a necessity to add to the list of memorials.</p>
<p>The second memorial I visited was the World War II memorial. I decided to visit this memorial for two reasons. The first one was because this was the first real World War that the United States had been involved in after it had gained its independence and recognition as a country. The second reason was because this war helped put the United States as one of the world leading powers. It helped show their strength and capability. This war made America what it is today. This memorial recognized all the states in America, and it recognized all the soldiers that died for America. I thought along with the Washington Monument, this memorial shows anther great turning point in American history.</p>
<p>The third memorial I visited was the Lincoln memorial. This one was my favorite of them all. The reason I choose this was because I am a big fan of Abraham Lincoln. I believe that as a president he really worked hard in shaping the American society. He was practical and realistic. He wanted peace and equality for his people. As a president, I think he contributed more in influencing the American society. Also, this landmark had anther significance. It was where Martin Luther King had his famous ‘I had a dream’ speech. This landmark is also adds to the turning points in American history.</p>

<p>George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln may have a lot in common, but two things stand out: they were all Presidents of the United States, and they all have memorials in Washington DC.  As Presidents, they are 1<sup>st</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>, and 16<sup>th</sup> respectively.</p>
<p>We represent our Presidents&#8217; greatness through the tools of scale, architecture, written word, pose and expression, and light.  These elements are not always present in the same amounts, but they all contribute to the overall perception of the memorial.  To investigate them, I visited and photographed the memorials of the four Presidents listed above.</p>
<p>The scale of a memorial impresses upon us the size of the shadow cast in history by the President being represented.    The Washington Monument is the most obvious starting place.  It stretches an impressive 555 feet, 5 ½ inches towards the heavens, immediately catching the eye.  The Lincoln Memorial is set upon a hill, with walls and columns that dwarf visitors. The seated statue of Lincoln is proportional to the building, and one feels as though he must be a great man by his stature alone.  The Jefferson Memorial is also a grand building but the part of the scale that really works there is the statue.  Jefferson is standing which makes his height seem all the more impressive.  Andrew Jackson&#8217;s equestrian statue (He&#8217;s on a horse) is also larger than life.  The pedestal upon which the statue is set is already tall, forcing the viewer to look up to see Jackson.</p>
<p>The architecture of the memorials is very reminiscent of ancient Greek and Egyptian styles, and associated with that is some measure of never-ending pride (Greek and Egyptian architecture are some of the grandest and longest lasting) for our Presidents.  The Washington Monument very much resembles the great pyramids of ancient Egypt, yet is a very separate and unique tribute to a great man.  Both Lincoln&#8217;s and Jefferson&#8217;s Memorials use Greek style columns: I saw Ionic and Doric.  Jackson&#8217;s Statue doesn&#8217;t have as much “architecture” per se, but the pedestal upon which it rests could be said to  exhibit some Egyptian architectural tendency.</p>
<p>The written word is a precise and powerful tool used to dedicate memorials and preserve forever the ideals of the President being represented, in his own words.  Epitaphs are present at the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials. E.g., from Lincoln&#8217;s, “IN THIS TEMPLE  \  AS IN THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE  \  FOR WHOM HE SAVED THE UNION  \  THE MEMORY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN  \  IS ENSHRINED FOREVER”.   Both have extensive texts written or spoken by Jefferson and Lincoln themselves.  The Washington Monument has significantly less. In fact, the only inscription that does not have to do with the construction of the monument is written on the east side, “LAUS DEI”, which means “praise be to God” in Latin.  The statue of Jackson bears the inscription, “OUR FEDERAL UNION, IT MUST BE PRESERVED”.  This is fitting since the statue is obviously a tribute to Jackson&#8217;s wartime contributions with him mounted on a horse in full uniform and four cannons at the four corners of his pedestal.</p>
<p>In memorials with statues, it is evident as an observer that pose and expression have a lot to say.  Looking up at Lincoln&#8217;s huge seated form, I am reminded of being a child at family gatherings.  Lincoln is reminiscent of some patriarch of the family, an uncle or grandfather, sitting in a favorite armchair.  He stares off into the distance with a serious look of contemplation, and you feel as though you shouldn&#8217;t disturb him.  Jefferson stands tall and proud, chest out, hands loosely balled at his side, and as with Lincoln, looking off into the distance as though seeing more than eyes can.  Jackson is astride a war horse which is reared up, and Jackson&#8217;s right hand holds forth his hat in a salute of sorts, but with the serious and sober look of a man fighting a war.  The Washington Monument is particularly notable for its lack of any statue whatsoever.  This seems to put George Washington on a higher plane than any of his more modern counterparts.  The lack of a statue seems to say that he was much more a god than a man, and only accessible as an ideal of perfect proportions.</p>
<p>Light is as much a tool during the day as during the night to accent the memorial.  The height of the front opening of the Lincoln memorial as well as what appeared to be sunlight filtering in from the ceiling affords excellent lighting during the day and there are light fixtures to provide illumination at night.  The Jefferson memorial is open on four sides and allows light to fall on his statue and the carved words on the walls and there are several lights in the ceiling here as well.  The Washington Monument and Jackson Statue are open air memorials, and are illuminated by the sun during the day.  At night, the Washington Monument has powerful spotlights that shine up its sides and make it a pillar of light.  The Jackson Statue, however, is NOT LIT AT ALL during the night, as is evident from my photographs.  I believe that, as it represents a President, it should be lit.  It&#8217;s a shame that the Metro is more well lit than a statue commemorating the accomplishments of a President.</p>
<p>When the elements discussed above are combined in the creation of a memorial, it is an amazing sight that brings history so much closer and more accessible to the average person and preserves the legacy of these great historical figures.  The next time I visit a memorial, I&#8217;ll be better prepared to appreciate all the work that goes into making them.</p>

					<p>While you may believe that with all of our high powered technology and scientific advancements, we will soon be in the age of the jetsons, that view may be completely wrong. According to Mayan Prophecies, the world is scheduled to end on December 21, 2012. Yes the Mayans were people who inhabited this planet a long long time ago back in 250 A.D., and technology then is not what it is now, but why is it that the Mayan calendar is still considered to be more accurate than the one that we use today. <strong>All of the Mayan doomsday prophecies to date have been correct and have actually occured, if we don&#8217;t start to take action now in finding a resolution, life as we know it may end.</strong></p>
<p>Although the Mayan civilizations communicated through hieroglyph drawings, they were actually a very scientifically advanced civilization. They possessed great knowledge within the realms of astrology, mathematics, timing, and calendars. They were even so precise that they had two calendars, one that was ritualistic and used for astral predictions and religious celebratrions. The other was a solar calendar. Both calendars were based upon a principle that a year had more than the 365 days, unlike the Gregorian Calendar in which we rely on to date. Through the use of these calendars Mayans were able to predict natural occurances such as Seasons and even eclipses. Something that in that day and age would seem almost impossible.</p>
<p>The Mayans figured through use of astrology and their two calendars that the earths rotation around the galaxy would take is 25,625 years to realign in the same manner. This period was then divided in to 5 cycles of 5,125 years. It was speculated that every 5,125 year cycle the earth would realign with the &#8216;central&#8217; galaxy theory, effectively changing the Sun&#8217;s magnetic fields resulting in catastrophic evens on earth. According to Mayan predictions we are currently in between the 5th and 6th cycles. More information about the prophecies and signs can be found <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/mjfinley/katun.html">here.</a></p>
<p>Overall the Mayans were way ahead of their time. The excess knowledge that they possesed is hard to comprehend without the use of modern day technology. It is debatable whether or not the world will actually end at the end of the Mayan calendar, or if we will just be transcended in to a new form of life. I guess we will just have to wait and see.</p>

					<p><strong>     The monuments and memorials in Washington, D.C. are designed and placed in a specific manner to remind the tourists and visitors of the accomplishments and achievements that those specific individuals did for the United States of America.  </strong>Our nation wishes to remember certain people and events in our history in a way that we will think and reflect upon the past and really begin to understand what that person or event represented. One might think that the architects and designers of these monuments and memorials designed them arbitrarily but when we look deeper and closer at how they are designed in combination to their surroundings and people’s feelings then we appreciate that these were designed with a definite purpose and reason.<br />
     My trip to Washington, D.C. led me to visit the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial and the Jefferson Memorial. I chose to visit these three because I wanted to analyze and study how these three structures were built and designed to commemorate three of our nation’s presidents. I found it very interesting to realize that the design layouts of these three structures along with the natural surroundings really represented the accomplishments that these three men left behind on our nation. Also I noticed that it could be possible that these monuments and memorials were designed to represent something of the men’s personalities and traits.<br />
     The Washington Monument was built to commemorate and honor the United States’ founding father and first President, George Washington. The monument is a very tall and white obelisk. I think the way this monument is designed and positioned has a lot to do with how the nation should remember Washington. The immense size and soaring stature of the monument represent the qualities of leadership Washington displayed in the struggle for American independence. The way the monument rises above everything in its presence really gives Washington’s title “Father of the Country” its true meaning. Since the monument is rising above all else and nothing else is allowed to ascend above it is a symbolic way of saying how Washington was the father and the leader of the United States. He raised and took care of the nation in its early life just as a father would to his young child. Also the US flags that surround the bottom of the monument seem to me to represent the rest of the people throughout history who stood up for and believed in Washington’s ideas. The natural surroundings also give the monument a very nice frame. The way the beautiful blue sky drops behind brings the monument to life. And the reflecting pool at the bottom gives off a feeling of serenity and peace when viewing the reflection of the huge monument. I believe the monument really embodies how the citizens of this nation want to show their gratitude and respect for the great achievements George Washington made for the United States.<br />
     </p>
<p>       Abraham Lincoln is the President for whom the Lincoln Memorial was built. This memorial was designed and constructed in a way to resemble a Greek Doric temple. Inside the memorial is an enormous seated statue of Abraham Lincoln. The sculpture of the statue, Daniel French, studied many photographs of President Lincoln before he created his sculpture. His conclusion for the design of the statue was to make represent Lincoln in a state of deep thought, thinking hard and somewhat meditative. His end result was the current seated statue of Lincoln staring out of the temple-like memorial towards the Washington Monument. Lincoln was known by people to be a very honest and a man of integrity, I think the memorial also gives the viewers a feeling of admiration and respect for Lincoln because of his outstanding characteristics. The huge columns around the memorial represent that they are upholding the top of a memorial of such an extraordinary person in the nation’s history, it shows that it takes such large pillars to support his personality. And then once inside the chamber of the memorial we get a feeling of wonder being in the presence of the sculpture of “Honest Abe”.  Again the natural surroundings seem to me to be a very nice fit for the memorial. The reflecting pool makes a nice addition to the frontend of the structure because it completes the overall look.<br />
            The Jefferson Memorial is dedicated to one of the founding fathers and third President, Thomas Jefferson. The memorial is a combination of circular steps, columns going around the memorial and a dome covering the top. The interior design of the ceiling is similar to that of the Roman Pantheon. The idea for the memorial was initiated by President Franklin Roosevelt, an idea which was no doubt proper. The design of the memorial reflects attributes of structures designed by Jefferson himself, for example Monticello and The Rotunda at UVA. Jefferson had an attraction and interest with Roman architecture which can be seen in his design elements. The memorial resembles the Pantheon of Rome in its design. Once we know this fact we can easily understand that Jefferson was fond of architecture of the Romans and this is present in his own memorial. Once inside the memorial the large statue of Jefferson is visible, the statue gives off the feeling that Jefferson was man of great caliber and talent. Indeed he was a person who had much talent since he was architect, author, inventor, etc. Being inside the memorial really makes one feel at peace and a feeling of serenity is felt. This I would say is due to the fact that the memorial is not visited by a large number of people at once. Being at the shore of the Potomac River Tidal Basin and then in addition to that being surrounded by the breathtaking Japanese cherry blossom trees, the memorial site produces a feeling of tranquility, harmony and peacefulness.<br />
     Overall the three monuments and memorials that I visited really gave me an idea and feeling of how they were designed, positioned and built to instill love and adoration in the visitors for these three presidents whom they commemorate.</p>

					<p>The National Mall is composed of many monuments and memorials. As you look at the different memorials you notice different design and structure. Each one of these monuments is designed differently. <strong>When looking at monuments on the national mall can we understand what the artist wants us to see. </strong>It is not hard to jump to conclusions and come up with many ideas which you think represent what the memorial is designed for us to see.</p>
<p>When looking at the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/organize/?start_tab=sets">Lincoln memorial</a> you walk up to the front and you see long steps which lead to giant pillars. The monument is designed to represent a graceful feeling as you walk up the steps to take a look at our 16<sup>th</sup> president. With the bright colored marble it’s a welcoming atmosphere; you see this by all the classy artwork. By classy I mean all the steps which you must climb to pay your respects to Abraham Lincoln. The roman designed pillars, which where considered a place of worship. All these things lead to an understanding that this man did a lot for the country and should be celebrated. As everybody know Martin Luther King also gave his I had a dream speech there which makes this place a historical place over and over again.</p>
<p>When you visit the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/organize/?start_tab=sets">Korean memorial</a> you notice a black wall from far way. This feels like a deterrent as something bad had happened it this war. You walk up to the black wall and notice no names just faces. Some of these faces are sad and some show no emotion. It seems like this war was not war that had many words, just reactions. When you look at the statues of soldiers walking you get a sense that there are very unhappy to be in this war. You notice that they are worn our and beat up. This is resembled by there heavy boots and there long rain coats. Looking at most of there faces again they show no emotion a lack of responsiveness.</p>
<p>When I visited the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/organize/?start_tab=sets">World War II memorial</a> you feel a sense of pride. The water running, great big waterfalls, and a perfectly even oval pool. You see the smaller memorials which represent the fleet ships which fought for us, and the two fleets are divided by the Atlantic and the Pacific. When looking at this great view you also notice the famous quote from FDR. It is outdoors and the sun shines bright on this memorial and you feel a sense of accomplishment as well as victory.  Everything is set into place when you vist this great marble.</p>
<p>As you visit different memorials you notice different feelings, and can be certain the designer of the momerial wanted you to think a certain way. As you gaze at differnt momerials you get a sense of what other people are also feeling and then can be certian that the artits as done his or her job.</p></p>

					<p>There are numerous monuments within Washington D.C. which represent the memory of either great events or those who took place in these great events.  The National Mall is almost like a tribute to all the historical events that America has gone through.  Each monument is trying to say something different from the World War II Memorial which is full of life and excitement to the Vietnam Memorial which is fairly plain and dark.  The elements of several of the monuments in DC which really impressed me is size and number.  The three monuments that contained the element over all others, for me, are the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Monument, and the Korean War Memorial.  <strong>The size of these monuments tries to illustrate the significance of the events or people that they involved and show that they should not be forgotten or taken for granted.</strong></p>
<p>While taking a trip to Washinton DC, it is almost impossible to miss the Washington Monument.  It is a giant white obelisk that sits in the National Mall.  You can see it from a lot of places in DC.  It is 555 feet and five and a half inches tall.  This monument is a tribute to our first president George Washington.  He laid down the path for America to rise to what it is today, symbolized by this monument.  He was a great president and he also played a crucial role in the American Revolution.  On top of the Washington Monument there are red lights that periodicalyl flash on and off.  This seems to show that regardless of what is going on in the country, there is always someone there to watch over America.  It was great going to the Washington Monument because of peoples reactions towards it.  Everyone standing near the base of it were saying things regarding the height.  They were all standing there with their heads looking straight up to try to take in the entire monument.  This awe that the monument inspires seems like a fitting tribute to a man who did so much for America.</p>
<p>The next monument I visited was the Lincoln Monument.  It sits right across fromt he Washington Monument with only the Reflecting Pool between the too, which is actually a very long walk.  When you first see this grand building, you really are taken back at just how massive it is.  It looks, fairly, similiar to the Parthenon from the outside.  The entire monument is raised off the ground and you have to climb many stairs just to get inside.  Once inside, you are still amazed at how big everything is.  The first thing you see is obviously Abraham Lincoln sitting in a throne.  His statue stands at nineteen feet tall.  Lincoln was a tall man in life, so his size in this monument helps illustrate this fact but mainly the fact that he was a great president.  He freed the slaves in America and helped pull the Union through the Civil War, which unfortunately led to his demise.  As you continue to look around the monument, on both sides of Lincoln are giants columns to support his monument.  On the far right and left sides of the monument are two of Lincolns speeches, the Gettysburg Address and his second inaugural address, both of which are gigantic as to show their importance.  The Gettysburg address is especially important because it helped rally the Union to continue the war.  Although short, it had a substantial effect on the American people.  It is one of the most famous speeches in America today.  Above both these speeches are large murals which are artistic representations of the work Lincoln did in his life.</p>
<p>I visited several other monuments in Washinton while<em> </em>I was there, many of which contained the element of size of number.  The one I ended up choosing was the Korean War Memorial.  I did not choose it because it made my project easier, because it didn&#8217;t, but because of the fact that not many people really talk about it.  It is know as &#8220;The Forgotten War&#8221; which is very disappointing because many people died in the call of duty.  This memorial is actually very interesting.  There are several soldiers who are all larger than life.  This symbolizes that they went above and beyond the call of duty to help another country in need and to defend what America stands for.  Their size also shows that America is a very powerful country.  Next to the soldiers is a large black wall, similiar to that of the Vietnam Memorial.  This wall is covered with faces of people.  The wall is quite tall, but the aspect that struck me was the number of people on this wall.  Many of these were soldiers or people involved with the armed forces, however they also had average people and children on it as well.  This shows just how many people were involved in this war and all wars.  Another part of the memorial was a pool of water which was line with plaques that listed the number of people who were injured, killed, or missing because of the war for the United States and the United Nations.  The numbers on these plaques were not small to say the least.  Many men lost their lives.  How we as Americans can overlook any conflict we were involved in, I really don&#8217;t understand it, however this monument shows that the Korean War is not an event to be overlooked.</p>
<p>The size of a monument helps to show the significance of the event or person it is meant to honor.  The Washinton Monument is meant to show just how important George Washington was to the birth of America which is illustrated by the size.  Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves against much opposition, and great achievement represented by a great monument.  Those soldiers involved in the Korean War went above and beyond the call of duty which is shown by the larger than life statues and their memorial.  Size always inspires awe in people, but when the size of a monument or memorial has a deeper meaning than just being a giant hunk of rock, it makes that monument or memorial all the more special.</p>

					<p>Our nations capital is full of statues, memorials, and buildings that are designed to preserve the history associated with them. Whether it is one of the massive monuments dedicated to a war or a president, or just a small house or building where a very important event took place, there is always much thought put into the design, and display of something so as to influence the way we are meant to remember it. <strong>The colors chosen to use at the monuments is Washington DC play a major role in the way we feel, and are meant to remember what ever it is that that memorial is meant to commemorate.</strong> Whether it is the pure black of the Vietnam Wall, the light colors of the Lincoln Memorial, or the striking lack of color at the Korean War Memorial, the people who designed the memorials put a lot of thought into how color should be used.</p>
<p>The first memorial I visited in DC was the Vietnam War memorial. The first thing that strikes you while visiting this memorial is the magnitude of people that were lost in this war. The wall is enormous in size, and completely covered in names of those that served and were lost in the war. The second thing that I noticed was the darkness around the Vietnam Wall. It was probably only about one or two o&#8217;clock when I was there, but standing up close to the wall you get a sensation of darkness. One reason for this is the fact the the wall is made of black granite, and casts a shadow on those standing close to it. The reason for the choice of such dark colors, in my opinion, is to remind us all that this is something that isn&#8217;t meant to be taken lightly. The wall contains the names of all those who either died, or were lost in combat and didn&#8217;t return home. I read somewhere that there are over 58,000 names on the wall. The use of black creates a similar atmosphere as when you attend a funeral, because this is a very serious monument to commemorate those who did not return alive.</p>
<p>The next memorial i visited was the Lincoln Memorial. Upon entering it was very clear that this memorial was a complete contrast to the last one i was at. At the Lincoln Memorial everything is done in very light, earthen colors. The ceiling off to either side of Lincoln is covered in yellowish-brown glass, which causes the light passing through it to create a very warm, almost up lifting feeling in the room. Lincoln is portrayed in solid white from head to toe, and the chair he is sitting in is also white. This, and the large Greek style pillars on either side of Lincoln make him appear almost god-like as he sits on his throne, and watches out over our nations capital. Also throughout history, white has been the color of purity, so by portraying Lincoln in nothing but white seems to portray him as an entirely pure being, and suggests that he was the savior of our country during his time as president.</p>
<p>The final monument I visited on this day was the Korean War Memorial. As I walked around this memorial I noticed very little color present. In fact the two predominate colors here are gray and black. The gray statues of soldiers almost seem to imply that these men are almost forgotten in history, and at the same time creates a mood similar to that of the Vietnam War Memorial. It is a very serious place to be. The whole monument seems more about preserving the memory of the soldiers that fought in this war, rather then celebrating it. In my opinion the most ominous part of this memorial is the black wall that runs the entire length of it. On the wall are engravings of portraits of soldiers, I&#8217;m not sure if these are actual people or simply random portraits, from the Korean War. The part about it that is almost spooky in nature is that as you are looking at the faces of these people, you can see your own reflection in the wall. In a sense its like looking at yourself on the wall, and seems to be almost a warning that if we forget this event, then something similar is doomed to happen again.</p>
<p>In conclusion, those who design memorials of great importance must put a lot of thought into what defining characteristics to use, in order to create the right kind of memory of an event or person. Color plays a major role in this by establishing an overall feel, and atmosphere at a memorial, and can even be used to hint at greater characteristics of something.</p>

					<p>Before visiting the national monuments, I wanted to know if there was a certain way that people acted while visiting certain monuments. Was their behavior going to be the same at all three of the monuments, or was it going to change at certain ones? <strong>While walking through the Washington Monument and Lincoln and World War II Memorials, I discovered that there is a difference in ambiance between the three memorials and thus a difference in people&#8217;s behaviors.</strong></p>
<p>There are three distinct differences between the three  memorials. The Washington Monument is totally outside, with just stone paving around the monument. There are no signs about conduct around, and it is a generally care-free atmosphere. Kids run around while yelling, and their parents do nothing about it. There is a flag for every state in our country, but they do not seem to serve a symbolical purpose, but just to make noise. There are no emotions associated with it, therefore no undertones of grief or mortality, unlike the World War II Memorial. The World War II Memorial is partially enclosed by fifty columns, one for each state, forming a sort of half-wall around the area. Everywhere you look, you can see engravings that remind us of the soldiers that died fighting, both for our country and for our cause. When children run, they are scolded. Some people talk loudly, but for the most part, they lower their voices. The pond in the middle has small fountains that add a soft, soothing sound to the atmosphere. It almost sounds celebratory, as though they were trying to keep the mood from being too somber, like the Lincoln Memorial. At the Lincoln Memorial, there are no fountains in the reflecting pool. Aside from the ducks swimming in it, it remains still, reflecting the building that a statue of Lincoln sits in. The building is totally enclosed, minus the archways leading to the inside of the memorial. Thirty-six columns line the front and sides of the memorial, once again symbolizing states. This time, they stand for the thirty-six states belonging to the Union at the time of Lincoln&#8217;s death. The inside of his memorial is peaceful. Children do not run. Signs guard the entrance, warning visitors to be quiet and respectful. Even those who do not notice the signs proceed with closed mouths, or at least soft voices.</p>
<p>Why is there such a difference between the three memorials? Could it be because of their layout, or because of the significance each one is associated with? I think that it is a mix between the two. Although I didn&#8217;t find any evidence supporting this, I think that there isn&#8217;t really any significance to the Washington Monument, it&#8217;s just celebrating George Washington as our first president. That, paired with the relaxed layout of the memorial, lets people act freely. With the World War II Memorial, things are a little bit more formal. Most people go there to not just visit, but to mourn or remember people or relatives that they knew in the war. Although there is no actual building, there are a kind of walls, which makes the memorial a bit more formal. There is also a sign prohibiting certain activities, such as eating/drinking, smoking, and running while in the memorial. Even though there is no sign prohibiting loud voices, people talk softly anyway out of respect for the memorial and those it stands for. Outside of the Lincoln Memorial, there were a bunch of people sitting on the steps, having conversations, watching kids play. It was noisy, and kind of chaotic while I was trying to make my way up the stairs. But once I got inside, the mood had completely changed. Although it was the most crowded, I would not have been able to tell, judging by the noise level. Few people were holding conversations, but they were very quiet about it. If they were not at least talking quietly, they were whispering. I think this has to do with both the structure of the memorial, and because of what kind of person Abraham Lincoln was. His memorial was the most formal, with full walls and a roof. It was made entirely of marble, and there was a huge statue of him in the middle, with two of his most famous speeches on either side of him; The Gettysburg Address on the left and his second inaugural speech on the right. It also resembles something of a museum, which makes everyone quiet down immediately upon entering. But when it comes to Abraham Lincoln himself, he is the most known and is remembered for all of the great things that he did, probably the greatest being the freeing of all slaves with the Emancipation Proclamation. Ask any first grader what presidents they know- I can guarantee that one of the few will be Abraham Lincoln. Everyone knows of him and respects him, and I think that is why his memorial is given the greatest amount of respect.</p>
<p>All in all, I think it is a mixture of both personal feelings and people&#8217;s surroundings that make people act they way they do around certain memorials. Granted, if there is a sign saying &#8220;please be quiet and respectful,&#8221; then most people will be quiet and respectful. But what is being memorialized also has a big deciding factor in how people act. So, if you want people to act a certain way at a memorial, be sure to consider the lay out and organization of the area, the feelings that you want the visitors to feel, and make sure that you add things that will play off of or generate the desired feelings.<br />

					<p>When exploring the different monuments in Washington D.C., one is able to find much of our Nations rich history. The different war memorials are something interesting to see, hard for some of us to remember the bittersweet existence of that part of our past. Although I enjoy most all of the monuments, I feel that the most important are those of our past influential presidents. I feel that it is important to remember each of the presidents for the things they accomplished during their terms and to be appreciative. <strong>Through the structure and display of the presidential monuments, we are able to understand their importance and the way in which our Nation would like to remember them.</strong></p>
<p>The first monument I explored and analyzed was the monument dedicated to the first president of our Nation, George Washington. I had already decided to explore this as I have always been interested in the history of George Washington and how our first president came to be. Also, my dad serves in the United States Navy, and is a member of the George Washington battle group, he serves on the Carrier. This has been a part of my life for so long, George Washington’s name puts a smile on my face and Patriotism in my heart. Once I was able to view the monument I felt it was very appropriately constructed for the importance Washington holds in our society. I had always wondered why they didn’t build a statue of him for us to remember him by, but after analyzing this structure and trying to find the symbolism of its existence I was able to understand the abstract existence of this monument in our Nations capital. The symbolism I found to explain why the monument is the way it is and not just a simply statue, is that Washington is in a sense our first father, he, with some help, began to build and lay the framework for the lives we live today. It is important that his monument be big and surpass all of the other structures in our capital because his is the base of it all, the heart of our government.</p>
<p>Next I viewed photographs of the Lincoln memorial and I was able to see immediately the complexity of this monument. A statue of Lincoln is housed in a huge temple resembling that of a Greek God. By seeing this I was able to understand that our Nation feels that Abraham Lincoln was very important. When considering the different possible forms of symbolism to draw from the structure I began thinking of what I pray for when I pray to God, or what the Greeks would pray to their Gods. A lot of times when I pray I am essentially praying for God to save me from something. After this I was able to draw some symbolism in the structure in which Lincolns statue is held. He saved our nation, this makes him a very powerful man, and we should ‘worship’ and ‘glorify’ him through remembering what he did for our Country.</p>
<p>The last monument I explored what that of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Through movies, like Pearl Harbor, I have come to appreciate more fully the decisions FDR made for our country. When viewing the different aspects of Roosevelt’s memorial I realized it was very different than the other two I had viewed. This memorial showed Roosevelt in different aspects of his life. I found this symbolically to show his dynamic personality. When choosing which aspects to write on I found the inscription behind the scene of Roosevelt sitting with his dog, the inscription talks about ‘new order,’ and that those seeking to build a government based on the needs of everyone by a few are not doing anything new and not having order. I had some question to what this meant exactly and their was debate among one of my historically intelligent friends and myself, a sadly clueless citizen. I felt that Roosevelt was stating what Democracy is not, and he was implying that Democracy is and should be a government ruled by the people. Then my friend informed me that this was probably said in efforts to rally the nation for World War II, and Roosevelt was simply stating we should fight for what is right, Democracy. I am able to understand where each of us believe what we do, although I feel we are both correct in our assumptions. Overall I enjoyed this monument because it showed different aspects of Roosevelt’s life, including those times in which he struggled. The monument is very influential because it also shows us citizens that amidst all of Roosevelt’s personal struggles he was a strong and proud man, standing for our nation.</p>
<p>Although I was not personally able to go into DC and view these monuments I have been told of each monuments history multiple times by my grandfather, a daily commuter to our nations capital. By exploring these monuments I felt a sense of shame because I realized how little I know about our nation’s history. I used to think it was funny that I was so clueless about our history, now I feel it is disappointing I am uninformed, our history is extremely interesting and people should want to learn about it. By viewing the monuments I also felt a sense of pride and Patriotism in knowing that I am a member of this nation.</p>

				<h2><a href="/courses/history120/spring07/911-mysteries.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to 9/11 Mysteries">9/11 Mysteries</a></h2>
				<small>May 8th, 2007 <!-- by Greg Yeh --></small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>As super paranoid, anti-(current) government, believer of conspiracy theories, I have exhausted the internet of conspiracy videos. After the horrific attacks upon our country on 9/11 I began to speculate more and more whether or not our own people were responsible for the tragedies. I watched hours upon hours of film, and read pages among pages of research on the topics at hand that could possibly shine some light on what really happened. It was not until I stumbled upon a video entitled <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6708190071483512003">&#8220;9-11 Mysteries&#8221;,</a>  that everything all became so horrifically apparent. <strong>While the government may still deny any involvement in the attacks on September 11th, this video makes it almost undeniable that there is some sort of cover up going on.</strong></p>
<p>The video, produced by a man name Brad, a conservative republican, is possibly the most scientifically analyzed approach at the topic. For Brad, the journey to conspiracy began actually when he viewed another documentary on the subject. &#8220;Painful Truths of 9-11&#8243; by Eric Huffschmidt was what set him out on his quest. Brad was determined to prove the documentary wrong, and along the way of his research he realized that it was actually the official report released by the government that was shrouded in lies and not the documentary. While the video does claim that the falling of the twin towers was not caused by the explosions of the planes that crashed in to the building, it does not point any fingers at anyone. Rather it leaves the opinion part up to the viewer to decide.</p>
<p>Even though the video is and hour and forty five minutes long, it keeps you captivated by the continual presentation scientific supported claims. The official FEMA and PBS documentaries are explained and then challenged, but again, no fingers are pointed to who did what, the video just shows you that what we are being told is not the truth and something is being covered up. The video uses a barrage of science and understanding to essentially show you the whole picture of what happened. Facts like the melting point of steel, the enormous core of the towers that just disappears, and comparisons of other steel structure that burned for 24 hours and were still standing were just some of the things that gave me a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach about what was going on. More over, the big business men involved in what happened, and their actions pre and post 9-11 were completely unreal. It is almost as if they have sold their souls to the devil.</p>
<p>I think that anyone that cares about the future of our country, anyone that may have lost friends or family because of horrible tragedies like this, anyone who is even alive should watch this video. It may be the one thing that changes your mind about how you perceive the men and women that supposedly represent your country. America seems to be getting pulled out of underneath our own feet, and soon enough we will all realize, but will it be too late?</p>

				<small>May 8th, 2007 <!-- by drooney --></small>

					<p>The three war memorials on the Mall (World War II, Viet Nam, and Korea) serve to remind us of the many who have died in defense of this nation. <strong>Surprisingly, though, none of the three memorials emphasize or feature a main theme of the glory of victory or the supremacy of American military might. Rather, all three are very consistent in emphasizing the burdens undertaken and the prices paid during wartime. </strong>It is these reminders of the lives lost in past wars that can potentially prevent future wars from occurring, if only these lessons could be understood and remembered by our political leadership at the times when the drums of war are being beaten by those who advocate a strong policy of American military intervention around the world.</p>
<p>When visiting the three memorials, it is easy to see which one contrasts with the other two. The Viet Nam War Memorial is different because, unlike World War II and the Korean War, the political divide surrounding this war has not been forgotten and is still being debated today. Even though the Viet Nam Veterans Association expressly asked for the Memorial to be non-political, its differences from the other two speak volumes. For example, the World War II Memorial has &#8220;Here we mark the price of freedom&#8221; inscribed on the ‘Freedom Wall.’ Similarly, at the end of your walk through the Korean War Memorial, you will find the words &#8220;Freedom is not free&#8221; inscribed opposite the number of casualties sustained in that conflict. At the Viet Nam Memorial, however, you will not find any similar adulating or laudatory words suggesting why we had to go to war. Instead, you will find only the names of the fallen. I believe that this speaks volumes about the legacy of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/65979628@N00/490217394/">Viet Nam</a> War and the enduring feeling that most Americans have in terms of the unjust reasons for that war.</p>
<p>The legacy portrayed by the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/65979628@N00/490217418/in/photostream/">World War II Memorial</a> is in stark contrast to the one portrayed by the Viet Nam War Memorial. The WWII memorial shows how the entire nation was joined in the war effort. Each of the States, plus the District of Columbia, is represented by the 51 pillars surrounding the memorial. Although the memorial makes some allusion to victory (unlike the other two), it mostly shows to what lengths this country had to go to achieve victory. Not lost in the celebration of victory is a memorial to the 400,000 fallen, represented by 400 gold stars, each representing 1000 of the fallen. One reason for the low key, but ever-present, allusion to victory found in the World War II memorial, and not in the Korean or Viet Nam memorials, is most likely that World War II was a cut and dry victory, with the Axis Powers having surrendered to conclude the conflict. In the cases of Viet Nam and Korea, however, these wars did not render a clear cut victor nor a clear cut benefit to mankind.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/65979628@N00/490237265/">Korean War Memorial</a> falls somewhere between the harmonizing and celebratory mood of the World War II Memorial and the sobering and somber mood of the Viet Nam War Memorial. This inconclusive mood is portrayed on the 19 faces of the soldiers featured in the monument. Some are stoic, some seem scared and some are even smiling. The Memorial has no mention of victory, but the words &#8220;Freedom is not free&#8221; are inscribed at the end directly opposite the number of casualties. The Korean War Memorial makes a point of depicting the racial diversity of the US soldiers who fought in the war (12 white, 3 black, 2 Hispanic, 1 Asian, 1 Native American), along with all the various facets of the military that were involved in the Korean War. Also, surrounding the memorial are marble panels honoring the 17 countries that provided combat support during the Korean War. It seems that those who designed this memorial wanted to depict a theme of domestic and international cooperation, along with the obvious and reoccurring theme of the heavy price of war. In the case of the US, the human price of the Korean War was 54,246 dead, 8,177 missing, 7,140 captured and 103,289 wounded.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our three war memorials serve not as trophies, but as sobering reminders of what happens when our government makes the decision to send young men and women off to war. Although the deaths of those memorialized by these three monuments were honorable ones, they tragically came far too early. One can only hope that future leaders of this country may consider a short walk to the Mall to confront the sober realities of war before they bend to the advice of those who have never paid any price in wartime to spread democracy to the &#8220;uncivilized&#8221; world by way of rifles, tanks and lucrative defense contracts.</p>

					<p>Countless number of people and events have been involved in our history. Among many people and events, there are the great heroes and the unforgettable events that strongly have affected our country. We do not want to forget our heroes. We rather want to memorize and honor them because they are the ones who have led our nation to this place today. The National Mall really reflects those ideas. <strong>The form of each memorial or monument on the National Mall shows how our ancestors have lived, how our country has developed, and finally answers where we came from by symbolizing their true meaning.</strong></p>
<p>I chose Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, and World War II Memorial. The reason that I chose Washington Monument is that it is a well-known American landmark and a symbol of the capital of the United States, Washington, D.C. The Washington Monument was built to remember the work and life of the first president of the United States, George Washington. George Washington earned the title “Father of our Country” in his leadership that caused American Independence. People of the United States show their respect toward George Washington throughout Washington Monument. The form of Washington Monument is obelisk, and the base of the monument is surrounded by fifty flags. The flags represent the 50 states of the Union. It reminds us Washington as a founding father of all the 50 states. Also, no other building in D.C. is taller than Washington Monument, and it stands at the heart of city. Once again, it shows the gratitude of people of the United States to the father of their country.</p>
<p>Lincoln Memorial honors the 16th president of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. I chose Lincoln memorial because the design of the memorial embodied liberty, equality, and unity in one structure. The building is in the form of a Greek Doric temple. Inside of the building, there are a seated sculpture of Abraham Lincoln and inscription of two speeches by Lincoln. The cavernous chamber shows a peaceful portrait of the greatness of the single man. The seated statue of Lincoln shows his belief that all people should be free and equal. When we look at the outside of the temple, we can see that the memorial is surrounded by 36 Doric columns, one for each of the thirty six states in the Union at the time of Lincoln’s death. Their names are on the frieze directly above. The columns surrounding the temple show unity of the states.</p>
<p>World War II memorial honors the more than 16 million who served in the United States armed forces during the WWII. The design of the Memorial symbolizes various aspects of the war representing unity, sacrifice, victory and freedom. First of all, at the western side of the memorial, the Freedom Wall contains 4000 commemorative gold stars, one for each 100 Americans who died in battle during World War II, and they show sacrifice of WWII. Secondly, the circular form of Rainbow Pool in the middle of WWII memorials, and the pillar surrounding it shows unity. Thirdly, the 56 pillars are adorned with bronze wreath represent unity and victory of country. There are also bas-relief panels depict scene from the World War II. By showing scene of battle, the panels commemorate the soldiers who fought in the war.</p>
<p>The unique design of Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, and World War II Memorial have their roots in earlier European architecture and also have their own symbolic meanings. The great American heroes and the important historical events harmonize with earlier European design to show our common heritage and the diverse culture that is our source of renewal. Moreover, the specific design of each memorial make people to think about what its true meanings is. While we explore the meanings of the specific look of each monument, we learn more about our history and know where we came from.</p>

					<p>When I was a little kid, I used to love taking the Metro train with my family to Washington, D.C. to visit the monuments and museums.  We would spend all day just looking at the monuments and memorials that were scattered throughout the National Mall.  I remember thinking that the “Pencil” had the eraser underground.  I later realized that it was just the Washington Monument.  My favorite memorial was the Vietnam Wall since it was completely different from every other monument that I saw.  I never really thought about why the designer made it that way or what it means when the Wall goes from smallest to largest then back down to smallest.  But now that I think about it, everything has a meaning in the National Mall.  There were three monuments that came to mind when we were first assigned this project, the Lincoln Memorial, Vietnam War Memorial, and the Korean War Memorial.  I decided to analyze how the people dedicated in each memorial were depicted to the public.  <strong>The way the monuments present people is how the public saw them by using color, size, and material that mean certain ideas.<br />
</strong>As I stepped from the escalator and walked towards the map to see where each monument was, I noticed how long the walk was to get to the Lincoln Memorial.  So I walked towards it and once I got to the new World War II Memorial and centered myself on the Reflecting Pond, I could see the entire Lincoln Memorial.  I still had a ways to go until I got to the first steps.  I noticed, as I walked up the steps, that the color and size of the steps changed as I got closer to the statue of Lincoln.  You will notice in this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488492660/">picture</a> that the color goes from a dirty brown color to a much cleaner pearl color.  The steps also become narrower, requiring taking more steps to move an equal distance.  This could mean that the immediate area around the statue of Lincoln is sacred, so the material has to be a cleaner white and only those who can make it up the smaller steps can see Lincoln.  If you complete the task of climbing up the stairs, you will see this huge God-like statue of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488492628/">Lincoln</a>.  Above Lincoln there is an engraving that uses the word “temple” to describe the memorial.  In this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488492642/">picture</a>, notice how Lincoln seems to be looking out towards Washington, D.C.  This is almost as if he is protecting the city from any harm, just like he did for the Union and the slaves during the Civil War.  To the left and right of the monument, there are these huge engravings of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488492634/">Gettysburg Address</a> and the Emancipation Proclamation, respectively.  As you can see by the Gettysburg Address, it basically takes up the entire wall.  This is to show that these documents are just as important as Abraham Lincoln was.  It is no wonder that Lincoln is considered to be our greatest president.</p>
<p>From the Lincoln Memorial, I walked over to the Vietnam War Memorial.  But before I could even get to the Wall, there was a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488492634/">statue</a> of a group of men that are just standing there.  These men are just about life-size and are made of a different material than the one used to make Lincoln.  It appears to be a bronze color, almost the same color as dirt or mud which is unclean.  Also notice that this statue has an African-American in it.  This was added most likely since the war was happening during the Civil Right movement.  There is also another <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488492720/">statue</a> very similar to this one, but it is on the other side of the walkway and it is there to honor the women who helped in the war.  As for the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488656805/">wall</a> itself, this picture shows just one panel that contains the thousands of names that lost their lives in the war.  The material is a dark, reflective marble that is like a mirror.  This war is the first one that the United States lost and it was a very dark time in our history with the war, assassinations, and the protests.  This <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488492668/">picture</a> was taken at the end of the Vietnam Wall.  You will notice that it starts out very low, coming up to the waists of the two women standing there.  As you walk towards the center, the wall grows to this huge structure that is twice as tall as anyone else observing it.  You will also notice that there is a space where spectators can pay their respects by placing flowers, cards, or photographs of their loved ones.  The different size of the wall can signify the problem of the war, or the number of troops sent overseas.  At first, it was only a small scale, but when LBJ received a blank check, the war reached its climax then slowly died down when it was realized that we were going to lose the war.</p>
<p>The Korean War Memorial is on the other side of the Lincoln Memorial.  I did not know that this memorial even existing until last year.  I guess it is because there aren’t many movies made about this movie.  But this is the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488604637/">first full view</a> you see when you walk towards it, a squad patrolling in what is mostly likely rain since they are wearing ponchos.  These life size statues are the major component to the Korean War Memorial.  As you can see, these statues are very close to the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488604659/">wall</a> that is similar to that of the Vietnam War Memorial.  The main difference in the two walls is that there are no names, but just faces of those who have lost their lives.  All of the military branches are represented in this wall.  Since the memorial has faces and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488604673/">life size statues</a>, the public probably thought the war was a better success than the Vietnam War, even though it was a draw.  The statues are a grayish color, which is neutral, which is another way of showing that there was no clear winner in the war.  This is a picture of the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488604681/">front view</a> of the patrolling squad.  Everyone is following the squad leader, but they are separated by a walkway made of the same material as the Vietnam Wall.  This could be a link between the two wars since it appears to be going towards the Vietnam War Memorial.</p>
<p>People have many different views on how wars or how people are.  In the case of the Lincoln Memorial, Lincoln is regarded as the greatest president this nation has ever had.  This is why he is shown as a huge God-like statue.  The Vietnam War Memorial shows the troops who lost their lives just as a list of names, that way no one can put a face to any names unless you personally knew them.  In the Korean War Memorial have life size statues next to a wall that has faces etched in it.  This way, spectators can see the ones who lost their lives.  All of this depends what the public think about the person or event that occurred in history.</p>

					<p>Beer. It&#8217;s so good when it hits your lips. This magical substance was first stumbled upon by accident in the 10,000 BC era by a group of nomads. They discovered that when the grains that were soaked by the rain, were left alone for a while, it would produce a drink that seemed to have mystical properties. This specific example was what caused the nomads to finally domesticate and stay in one place, so that they would have a steady supply of raw material for their beers. Not only did the beer possess mystical qualities, but it also served for an evolution point of the human race. Until about the eighty and ninth century AD, beer remained pretty standard and followed its original recipie. It was then in Central Europe that Hops began to make a mark on the beer industry. <strong>Although beer did not explode in the United States until about the mid nineteenth century, the brewing, quality, and selection of beer have since went on a rampant evolution. </strong></p>
<p>In the 1620&#8217;s, Pilgrims on the Mayflower land at Plymouth rock, it is said that the choice to land at Plymouth Rock could have reinforced by the shortage of supplies, especially beer. The next evolution of beer came through in the 1820&#8217;s through the form of trying to get beer to keep longer. English brewers began to brew beers with increasing amounts of hops, so that they could withstand the long journeys without going bad. By increasing the amount of Hops in the beer they effictively alterd the recipie and were left with what we refer to today as an India Pale Ale. It is possible that the name was taken because these brews were made to carry on the journeys that were made to Britan&#8217;s colonies in Asia.</p>
<p>The year 1819 came rolling in, thanks to Thomas Holloway came the new invention of the steam engine, the first of its kinda to be used in American Beer Production. 1829 marked the year that David G. Yuengling opened what today is America&#8217;s oldest operating brewerey in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. In 1844 another famous brewery was started by Jacob Best in Milwaukee, this would later transform in to the Pabst Brewing Company, makers of that wonderful can of PBR. In 1852, George Schneider laid the ground work for what would become the Anheuser-Busch Brewing company. By the early 1900s there were over 2,000 breweries in operation in the United States. They continue to grow and produce more and more beer, but prohibition begins to be adoped and enforced.</p>
<p>It was at this point around 1910 that breweries begin to decline to around 1500. by 1912, Nine states voted to be Dry, by 1916 23 states were dry. Eventually by 1919, with that passing of the 18th Amendment, National Prohibition put a dent in to the beercan. Distilleries were closed by acts of the Food Control Law, and breweries began producing &#8216;near beers&#8217;. It was not until about 1933 that prohibition was lifted and brewers started up again with operation. In the years from 1940-1951, the tax on barrels of beer rises from $5.00 all the way up to $9.00. This additional burden on the breweries causes many to close down, resulting in around 400 breweries being in operation. 10 more years go by and only 230 breweries remain, but the introduction of the aluminum can by Coors brewing of Golden, Colorado, and the ring pull can spark new hope for the beer companies. By 1969 canned beer began to outsell bottled beer for the first time.</p>
<p>In 1982, we saw the first Brewerey / Pub. From the first time since prohibition, a brewery was allowed to open to no only sell beer, but also sell food out of the same venue. This is what we know as bars today. Anywhere you go, that serves beer of course, owes thanks to Bert Grant&#8217;s Yakima Brewing and Malting  Company. in the following years, brewing companies continue to decrease in number, but those that survived were expanding operations. by 1984 the top 6 brewing companies were controlling 92% of the beer production for the US.</p>
<p>In the following 20 years many advancements would break through in the beer game. From fridge packs to plastic can liners, beer brewers were dishing it all out. Today we have all sorts of past times connected through beer, Baseball games, drinking games, barbecueing, you name it, beer is probably there. Beer is sold everywhere, even at small resturant style pizza shops.<br />
While beer assisted in the transition from nomadic hunter gather to a more domesticated form, these days it seems to do the complete opposite. People go from being domesticated, normal human beings to complete waste cases that have no bodily control nor brain functions. I guess you cant really expect less and according to a recent Brewers Association 2007 Beer Style Guideline, it was found that there are offically 125 different styles of ales and lagers produced around the world! With that many choices to choose from, you know someone is out there opening a beer as your finish reading this.</p>

					<p>On September 11, 2001, everyone was continuing their every day life when something teriible happened to our country. An airplane hit one of the twin towers without any warning. the look on the people&#8217;s face was shocked and scared. No one knew what exactly was goin gon. Later on maybe an hour has passed; another plane had hit the other twin tower. With these two buildings all of a sudden gettin ghit by airplanes, something was not right. The investigation of the two airplanes striking both the two twin towers needed to find out the truth behind it.</p>
<p>With two airplanes that all of a sudden hit two of the twon towers wasn&#8217;t normal at all. As the day went on, investigation started to began tryin gto fin dout the reason behind this terrible problem. As the days went on, the police investigator started to suspect that it was a terrorist attack. The leader behind this terrible act was from Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda terrorist network. Once Bush found out about this news, he declared &#8221; war on terror&#8221;.</p>
<p>Osama bin Laden has been a prime suspect against the United States. Since 1998, Osama bin Laden has been linked to several attacks including the embassy bombings in De res Salaam, Nairobi, Kenya, and Tanzania. According the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Osama bin Laden is wanted for the top ten fugitives. Although for all o fhis involvements, the September 11 attacks is far worst then all of his involvements combined together. Although Osama bin Laden has not been idicted for the September 11 attacks, he has taken responsibility for those attacks.</p>
<p>As a citizen in the United States, we must be aware for all the issues that is going around. People like Osama bin Laden can be everywhere withought knowing it. Osama bin Laden as an  individual has taken so many innocent lives. The fact that Osama bin Laden has taken responsibility for these terrible accidents will never be forgotten. Osama bin Laden will always be remember as we gon on with out lives and for many future generations to come.</p>

					<p>Washington DC, the<em> </em>piedmont of democratic practices for the world, for the United   States, is also a great tourist attraction. Behind every monument or memorial is a historical background that attempts to be told through the structure. However, when these monuments are viewed through a touristic lens, the context of these monuments and memorials is assembled as being iconic to American ideologies and represent our history. Popular culture views these monuments in their pristine. But what about when the lights go off, when the monuments are not presentable to the populous? What do they look like at night? How does the lighting of these structures tell the story? <strong>Well, the lighting of each individual structure shows how we really want the memorial to be viewed. </strong>Because in the day everything is lit up, however, at night we select specific aspects to light up.</p>
<p>The first Stop I took was to the Lincoln Memorial. The first thing you see is its signature steps that leads up to Lincoln sitting in his Chair. During the day you can see straight in, and everything around Lincoln. But at night there are specific things that are being lit. One of the biggest things is that, Lincoln him self is not totally lit up, only his upper torso and hit head. I believe this is because when we think of Lincoln we think of his long face and beard. The lighting makes him appear with out a beginning or end. So almost as if to say he will all ways be looking over our nation. On other striking element to the Memorial is that all of the engravings are not lit up, unlike other engravings in other memorials. This could be because you not actually aloud into the memorial after dark, so there is no need to light the passages up.</p>
<p>If you walk down the reflection pool towards the Washington monument, before you reach the monument you will come upon the World War II Memorial. This is the newest monument in DC and is the most impressive by far. There are two large fountains in the center with a large number of smaller fountains surrounding them.  Also the stone structures that make up the actually memorial are all free standing pillars with the names either states, US provinces or allied forces under the wreaths. The lighting was very interesting because the pillars were not as lit up as the fountains. So there wasn’t as much recognition given to the people that actually fought in this war. Most of the light was focused in the middle towards the water; this is because water normally signifies peace and harmony. This Memorial is not to actually give recognition to the people that fought and lost their lives as much as it is to signify peace in the world.</p>
<p>The third and final memorial that I visited was the Washington Monument. It is one of the first things that you see as you enter our Nations capital. The Sheer size of the Monument is overwhelming when standing next to it. I picked this monument as my last one because it signifies America, in that we will always an enormous power in the world today.  The lighting around the structure is massive in itself. There are 12, large lights that are stationed 300 yards away that light up monument from middle to top. Then there are about 68 smaller lights that light up the bottom to the middle.  We want the world to always be able to see our power, and the monument signifies power.</p>
<p>The monuments are meant to be viewed in certain ways. The lighting is only a guide in how the creators wanted us to view there master pieces. This was a different stance on the memorials and monuments but it shows them in a different view. I hope that this has open your eyes to a different view of our history.</p>

					<p>I chose the Vietnam War, Korean War, and World War II memorial because of their similarities and differences between each monument. The Vietnam War memorial consists of two triangular black long walls that sink into the ground. One edge is pointing at the Lincoln memorial while the other end is pointing at the Washington memorial. The Korean War memorial has a long granite wall which has names of soldiers and sketches of soldiers. Near the wall, there are nineteen stainless steel statues that depict moving across the battlefield. The World War II memorial consists of pillars with the name of each state on it surrounding a water fountain. For every 13 pillars, there is a much bigger pavilion which has a wreath on it. <strong>The Vietnam War, Korean War, and World War II memorial all have some type of similarities but it is the differences that make them unique as a whole.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong> <strong>            </strong>The Vietnam War memorial overall view looks like a long black wall that stretches quite a long way. Near the black wall, there are three life size steel soldiers. When the tourists comes and see this monument, they think about all the lives that was lost whose names is written on the black wall. The tourist itself had no interaction with the other tourists and with the memorial, the tourists looked at the names and as they look at the names they can see their reflection from the black wall. The Vietnam memorial symbolizes a piece of history that no one will ever forget.</p>
<p>            The Korean war memorial overall view consist of nineteen life size steel soldiers as if they were on the battlefield, a water fountain, and a long black wall that has sketches of soldiers and the names of lives who were lost during the battle. The tourist’s interaction near the life sized soldiers was quite minimal. Every once in awhile, there will be short sentences coming from here or there. I notice that when the tourists were looking at the wall, there was absolutely no sounds coming from anywhere but then again, they were paying close attention to the names and the sketches that was all over the wall. The Korean War memorial will teach future generations and will mean a lot to the people that actually fought in it.</p>
<p>            The World War II memorial was the largest memorial out of the Korean War and Vietnam War memorial. The memorial consists of columns that surrounded a water fountain. Each column represents a state which is written on the pillar. Also on the pillar, there is a green wreath placed in front of the pillar towards the inside. The name of each state is placed on the outside part of the pillar. I notice that the interaction between the tourists itself was very deep and thoughtful. The tourist’s interaction with the monument was very open and surprised. I think it’s because of the height of the columns that made the tourists surprised and the fact that the memorial was very spacious. The World War II memorial is a great way to remember all the lives that were lost during an important time in U.S history.</p>
<p>            The Vietnam War, Korean War, and World War II memorial all have similarities and differences from one another. In fact, the Vietnam War, Korean War, and World War II memorial all have a water fountain by its side. While the Vietnam War and Korean War memorial both have a long black wall and life size soldiers nearby. The World War II memorial is the only memorial out of the Vietnam War and Korean War memorial that has pillars with each state written on it. I chose these three specific monuments because of their differences and similarities that define each time period with their unique design. The Vietnam War, Korean War, and World War II memorial will forever be in our mind and represent the lives that were lost.  <a title="Pics" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/14675687@N00/">Pics</a></p>

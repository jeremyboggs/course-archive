<p><strong>The use of images can be helpful in understanding history because it gives you an actual look at what happened during the event that is being depicted, however you must be careful with images because they may be a biased look at the event.</strong> The <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/exploring/18thcentury/bostonmassacre/assignment.php">picture</a> by Paul Revere showing the Boston Massacre shows the side of the American people involved in the incident. Before describing what the picture shows, we must understand what actually happened in the Boston Massacre. A barbers apprentice was yelling at a British soldier because he thought that the soldier had not paid his bill. The soldier had in fact paid it but paid no attention to the boy. The boy continued to yell at the soldier so the soldier clubbed him. This act wound up creating a large mob of angry Americans who through things at the soldiers. The soldiers then called in for reinforcements. A chunk of ice hit one of the soldiers and knocked him on the ground and he fired into the air as he fell. Apparently, someone had yelled &#8220;fire.&#8221; This led to the rest of the troops firing into the crowd (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_massacre">wikipedia</a>). In the picture, Captian Preston is behind a line of troops with his sword raised ordering them to fire into the crowd of Americans. It seems to be depicting a hateful and uncalled for act by the Captian. In reality, one of the soldiers that was trying to keep the mob at bay. The troops are shown right next to the mob of Americans viciously gunning them down. There are huge clouds of smoke in the picture due to all the gunfire. The American crowd is larger than that of the British soldiers and is shown as completely innocent and scared. They seem to be cowering, trying to help the injured, and three dead mean on the ground.</p>
<p>This picture is being used to show the Americans being completely massacred, hence the name of the event, for no apparent reason. Revere must have wanted this picture to horrify Americans because he made some changes in the picture. First of all, he changed the name of the building behind the soldiers from Customs House to Butcher&#8217;s Hall. This makes the British seem like they are killing the Americans for no good reason. Secondly, the Americans are no retaliating what so ever and look completely innocent. Now nothing that I read says the Americans retaliated when the British started shooting, but they definitely were not being peaceful prior to the shots being fired. It seems Revere just wanted Americans to see this event as an innocent group of Americans were just walking around town and then some soldiers came and shot at them for no good reason. The British may not have been just in their actions, but it was not them just shooting Americans for no reason.</p>

			<p>You went above what you were suppoded to do for this post by going into detail about what really happened. Good Job. In your second paragraph, I think you strayed away from the questions that you were supposed to be answering, switching back and forth between the truth and Revere&#8217;s &#8220;truth.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Although there was no clear thesis statement for me to follow, your writing and explanations were excellent. I loved how you told the whole story, both view points aside, and listed the facts of what happened. The Boston Massacre happened because of freak accidents that catipulted to a massacre. I love the examples of how Paul Revere changed the name of the building behind to be a butcher shop. That was a good way to show a form of bias on his part.<br />
The only part of your paper that I did not like was the fact that there was no clear conclusion. You started out so well in forming our opinions of the circumstances and then just left us, in what seemed to be the middle of your blog. To agree with Colin, you went above and beyond giving us facts as well as what you think the representation meant. GREAT BLOG!</p>

			<p>Having a clear image in my head, I now somewhat know how the fight began. Obviously, someone from the American troop accused someone from the British troop for not paying a bill and therefore all hell broke loose. From experience, you should never accuse someone for doing something that they did without having any proof. It’s clear that if you accuse someone of doing something and they’re innocent, they will do whatever it takes to prove that they are right. That is how the British handled the situation by firing at the Americans. If I was in that situation, I would’ve found another way to handle this.</p>
<p>This post didn’t have a thesis therefore I didn’t know what you wanted to prove otherwise, it was well written and they had put a lot of thought into it. I like how they used outside sources to back up their information. The picture itself cannot explain every detail and sometimes you don’t know what is going on in the picture. The outside sources that they used really help me understand the meaning behind the picture. With the outside sources, I now know why it was drawn like this and what the picture really means.</p>

			<p>You are right and I agree with you. Yes, Paul Revere definitely manipulated the picture in order to create something. I think that his point was to make it so that he could rile up the Americans. If he showed people the mistreatment of the British, they would be angry and ready to fight for the American cause against the British. In a sense, it is a very useful tactic and a good way to quickly gain support. This also goes with why he portrays the Americans as these innocent people. Yes, of course, it is like you said, I am sure the Americans were not just sitting there innocently not saying a word. </p>
<p>I enjoyed reading your post. To me, it was a very informative piece. I really liked how in the first paragraph you went into detail describing what took place in the Boston Massacre. For people who have no idea what happened, this would certainly clear it up. As a result, I think that maybe you should have spent a little more time talking about the picture and analyzing it. I would keep your description of the event, but I would add some more analysis. Good blog!</p>

			<p>I really liked how in your introduction you descrbibed what actually had happened before the Boston Massacre even started.  Describing what had happened helped organize your paper very well and it helped the reader understand the picture twice as more.  Describing the picture is great, but you went to the next level and told the readers what actually happened to lead up to this shooting, which made your essay even stronger.  Good job with that.</p>
<p>One critisism I have is with your thesis statement.  Your thesis didn&#8217;t really have a arguable statement so I couldn&#8217;t really tell where you were going with your essay while I was reading it which made it very difficult to comprehend.  Just try to work on your thesis a little more and have an arguable statement so you can use it throughout your whole paper.  Other than that great job!  Again, I really liked how you went to the next leve.</p>

			<p>You are right that the images portrayed to us are not reliable because it only shows one perspective.  The Americans could have very well made it seem worse than they were actually treated.  This is understandable because they were treated unfairly.  Just as you mentioned, it is important to have knowledge of our history before making assumptions looking at biased images.  It may also not even be reliable looking at a cartoon from the American&#8217;s and British point of view because they could exaggerate the truth and twist around the facts.</p>
<p>I enjoyed reading your blog post.  However, you should have added at least one more paragraph.  The first paragraph should give background information to further pass your thesis statements.  The second or the next few should consist of supporting facts.  The last paragraph should conclude your thesis over viewing your facts.  You probably know this already, my suggestion for you is to just add at least another paragraph.  Overall, I think you came up with some great points!</p>

			<p>Thankyou for posting what actually was happening in the picture (and for creating a link to the picture). It puts a whole other persepective on both the picture and Revere. I learned a lot from your blog. I did not know that the Americans were retaliating because a British soldier clubbed a boy on the head for arguing his &#8220;unpaid&#8221; barber bill. Having this knowledge of the event makes it seem more realistic and &#8220;fair.&#8221; I mean it is not fair for the British soldier to club the innocent boy then call for reinforcements when the Americans retaliated. It all seems like a big misunderstanding to me. The gunfire started by accident when a British soldiers gun was accidently fired into the air as he fell from being struck by an object thrown at him by one of the Americans.<br />
Rever&#8217;s depiction of the event is a little sympathetic to the Americans. He changed the name of the shop to Butcher&#8217;s Hall. Why would he change it? I do not understand why you wrote, &#8220;This makes the British seem like they are killing the Americans for no good reason.&#8221; How does changing the name of a shop make it seem like they were killing for no good reason. They were killing for no good reason no matter what the name of the shop they are fighting in front of is.<br />
Too bad Revere did not depict what the Americans were doing before the British started shooting. I do agree that it was not fair for the British to be using gunfire on unarmed men. That is not a fair fight and just makes them appear evil. Also, Revere depicts Captain Preston as weak and cowardly. He is hiding from unarmed men and just shouting orders. What makes him not get in and fight. He is equal to his men, he is not better than they.</p>

			<p>I really enjoyed reading your blog. It really helped that you gave a background to what happened and this helped us to understand some of the biases in the picture. I learned a lot from the background, especially the part about how the boy wrongfully accused a solider of stealing. Also, it was really helpful that you gave the link to the picture, as well as the wikipedia link after you described the background information.</p>
<p>The main thing I would reccomend you change is your thesis. You sort of contradict yourself when you say &#8220;can be helpful &#8230; because it gives you an actual look at what happened during the event that is being depicted, however you must be careful with images because they may be a biased look at the event.&#8221; Instead of making it so wordy, you could try to state simply that a picture gives off the point of view that the artist wants it to convey.</p>

			<p>I think you brought up a very important point about the events of the so called Boston Massacre.  I agree that the British troops were instigated by the Americans, I have also heard about how the British soldier had somthing thrown at him.  You cannot expect to get away with throwing things at another countries soldiers.<br />
Your blog was very well written and explained many issues surrounding the Boston Massacre, the only thing that you could do to improve it is correct a few gramatical errors.</p>

			<p>You did a great job in comparing the actual events of the Boston Massacre, as we know them, to what Revere portrayed in his painting. You were able to do this well by looking up the “actual” history on Wikipedia. As you mentioned and made very clear, paintings or pictures can give a biased view of what actually happened. By reading your post, it really made me want to understand the motivations of Paul Revere to make this picture the way he did. Clearly Revere had a lot of motivation to make the British look bad and did so in a lot of ways in this painting.</p>
<p>Contrary to your thesis statement, I don’t think paintings or drawings portray what actually happened in the event they depict, but instead give insight into the thoughts or feelings of the artist. Revere obviously showed that he felt the British were evil for shooting unarmed Americans, but this painting fails to mention that the British were provoked. You did a good job in showing this throughout your post, but I feel that you were almost disproving your thesis statement. Also, I feel that you could have discussed more about the symbolism that Revere used in his painting to get his point across, and why you think he decided not to depict the actual truth. As an example, I found it interesting that he put the British on the right side and the Americans on the left side. Perhaps this painting was a depiction of how he felt about the relationship between the British and the Americans in general. Overall, I think your post was interesting.</p>

			<p>I really enjoy read your blog, because you described it with many detail. You even talked about what happened before the Boston Massacre even started. And you also add picture link and information link into your blog. After read your blog, I can really understand how Boston Massacre was begun, and why they were shooting at American. I agree with you, that was not fair fight between British and American. American were unarmed, but the British were still shooting at them.<br />
Your blog is very good. However, there was something wrong with your blog. It was your thesis statement. You didn’t followed your thesis statement all the way though your writing. If you can change your thesis statement a little, that will make this blog perfect. Over all this is very good writing and I really like it a lot.</p>

			<p>I thought this post did a good job at mentioning facts about the Boston Massacre. Some people might not know what went on with the Boston Massacre and by just looking at the picture would assume that the British just attacked an innocent bunch of americans. Because you provided facts about what really went on that day, the reader can then make their own assumptions about the picture and the way the artist is trying to portray each side. So I really liked the facts you provided and it helped me understand the picture better.</p>
<p>Even though I thought that the facts were good and did a good job helping your post out. I think you got away from the picture some and didn&#8217;t talk about the picture as much as you should of. I think you should of went into more detail of the picture and describe it more and what is going on and try to shorten up the facts some to make more room or keep the facts the same just add more to what you thought of the picuture and how it was suppose to be interpreted by the people that view it.</p>

			<p>The detail you provided in your post was very helpful in understanding it better. I agree with you in that Paul Revere did change the picture in a way to lift up the spirits of the Americans. It&#8217;s true that the pictures do only show one perspective of the story, so they are not fully reliable in that regard. You seem to have written a good post on the Boston Massacre, I really enjoyed reading it. I think you should have written more about the picture to balance out the post with all the facts.</p>

			<p>I thought it was good how you gave a brief run up of the events prior to the image seen in the painting and used those events to prove your point. I felt like this approach gave you a much stronger argument because rather than just saying it was a one sided painting, you told why it was a one sided painting. I hope that makes sense, or comes across as I am trying to. I thought your conclusion was a little abrupt but that is the hardest part of an essay, and I thought you did a very good job of everything else.</p>

			<p>I really enjoyed reading your post. It was very interesting and well written. I agree with you that pictures help people understand the past better, but are sometimes they are just bias views of one person. I don’t really think that the Americans just stood around while the British shot at them. I also don’t think that the British were that evil to shot at crowds with woman around. And if he changed things like the name of buildings, I think that he was capable to change what really happened.</p>

Either I don&#8217;t remember learning that version, or I have just never heard the real story before. It&#8217;s interesting how it seems that almost everything from this time period is biased against anyone who was an enemy of America.</p>

			<p>I liked that you explained what exactly happened in the Boston Massacre. I think telling about the actual event makes readers understand more about the event as well as the painting. Also, your explanations are very informative because you gave many details.<br />
Moreover, I agree with you that the painting has bias, showing just one perspective of the event.</p>
<p>In my opinion, you do not have a clear thesis. Your thesis statement have two different points; images are helpful to understand history, but they may have bias. It is confused because those two different points are kind of contradicted each other. I think your paper would be better if you made just one clear point in the thesis statement. Actually, I feel like your writing as whole not really deals with the thesis. Other than that, your paper is really nice.</p>

			<p>It helped that you did some background research on the Boston Massacre on Wikipedia and got real information.  I had no idea that the massacre was all started because of a haircut.  The link made it a lot easier to see what you were talking about.  I just want to know why there is a dog just standing in the middle of the picture with all the shooting.<br />
The only thing that I was having trouble with was your thesis statement.  You are only supposed to have one idea in a thesis, but it seems like you have two.  You cannot  have a helpful understanding of history when there maybe some bias in them.  You should just pick one and roll with it.</p>

I couldn’t see how you got that entire story out of the picture at first, but then I realized you had left a link of the wikipedia story about it. Also, good way to use wikipedia to explain this picture in further detail. I was interested with how you explained the way there was a bias in this picture. Once you look at it closer you really can tell that the Americans look really innocent in the painting but it probably wasn’t true.</p>

			<p>I like how you make the point that the Americans weren&#8217;t really being so peaceful before the attack as the depiction makes it seem during the attack. Revere uses the Americans looking completely helpless in order to strike a chord in the hearts of other Americans. </p>
<p>The only thing that I did not like in your post was the way your thesis was worded. It  just seems sloppily worded. I think there is a more concise way to put your thesis, and it would probably be even better if you just made your thesis into two senteces. It&#8217;s not illegal.</p>

			<p>This was a very good blog, both in structure and in substance.  The actual description (although I am sure it has been hotly debated), was great, I had always heard there was far more (or less) to the Boston Massacre than depicted by Revere.  The actual account and the small details the author noticed shows that the author did a great deal of research, and went far beyond just looking at the picture and drawing obvious conclusions.  In the final paragraph the author does a good job of proving the thesis, the two pieces of evidence provided do a more than adequate job of showing Revere’s obvious biases.<br />
The only have one critique on this blog and that is that there was no discussion of how the picture was viewed in its time, before it was considered a part of history.  The author of this blog makes reference to Revere wanting to depict the Boston Massacre as the slaughting of innocent Americans by the wicked British.  But, the author does not address the question of why Revere would want to paint this image, and what if any reaction he may have been trying to provoke from the public.</p>

			<p>Overall this blog was extremly informative. I felt that the essay was extremly effective in showing how pictures can have biases. Instead of just stating what the picture is depicting and adding that it might include biases, you laid out what actually led to this scene. The reason this was so effective for me was because I am horrible at remembering instances in History, and also I am easily swayed by media, even with things being told aren&#8217;t true. One thing I liked that you added was how the sign in the background was changed to &#8220;Butcher Hall,&#8221; although I felt there was a little more room for interpretation for this. I would try to find so other intstances where the British may be portrayed as &#8216;butchers.&#8217; Another part of the essay I felt was a little weak was the ending, instead of taking a stand or explaining the picture, the essay simply says well the British did this, which wasn&#8217;t entirely right, but it wasn&#8217;t for no reason at all. I felt that instead of focusing on the picture at this point the essay had turned more into the actual event.</p>

			<p>The amount of detail in your post was very good. You included the story of how the Boston Massacre actually occurred. I think by including, this piece of information in your post it made it more credible and believable. I think you are absolutely correct that Paul Revere was trying to make the British army look evil and brutal. However, I do not think that this information is shocking or new. As an advocate of the colonist, it makes complete sense that he would have drawn a picture that made the British look bad. By doing so it would gain the support of colonist who was wavering between their allegiance to the crown and colonies.</p>

			<p>Starting the post with a description of the actual events as they transpired was a nice touch. This sheds new light on the picture for the uninformed observer.  Looking at the picture, I now wonder if perhaps the colonist on the ground, front and center with a head wound, is the boy who was simply looking for payment, and got clubbed for his trouble.  </p>
<p>On the negative side, it seemed like three paragraphs would have been more appropriate.  I saw three distinct elements: historical, pictorial analysis, and analysis of Revere&#8217;s motives;  but there wasn&#8217;t really enough structure to see them as separate thoughts.  The first part of paragraph 1 is clearly history, while the last part is a mix of history and pictorial analysis.  The second paragraph is a combination of pictorial analysis and analysis of Revere&#8217;s motives.  This could have been written more clearly.</p>

			<p>You have done a very good job of learning as much as you can about this to relate as much as possible from the picture to the reality of what actually happened. Other than a few spelling mistakes I don&#8217;t really see too much that you could work on to make it better.</p>

			<p>You post was very interesting and detailed. Your description of the picture was very good and easy to picture even if you could not view it. Describing what happend with the solider as he fell shows confusion between the British. With the mistake by the British to fire upon the Americans, show them as being heartless and very evil. Good Support and evidence your blog I really enjoyed it. Great job.</p>

			<p>I would have to say your post was excellent. By reading your post I can totally imagine how the Boston Massacre occurred. I loved how you inform the reader how it led up to the Boston Massacre. It was very informative. It also helped me understand the picture clearly.<br />
I do agree with you that images portrayed to us are biased and shows only one perspective. The picture could also have a lot of exaggeration in it. It might have not been that bad as shown in the cartoon.<br />
All in all, you had an excellent post. It was very easy to follow along and very informative. It gave me a clear picture on how and why the Boston Massacre occurred. Great Post.</p>

				<p>In “Remember the Titians’, an African-American coach named Herman Boone is hired to guide a football team which is integrated but racially polarized. Set in Alexandria, Virginia, in 1971, Boone faces an awkward relationship from the team’s players and the assistant coach Bill Yoast, who is a local white man. Being an assistant coach under an African-American man creates a lot of tension between them. As the two men surpass their differences, they began to work together transforming the football team into a winning team. <strong>Seeing the characters going through a serious issue shows us that despite our differences, we can still work together.<br />
</strong>The movie’s overall message is that you shouldn’t judge anyone by the color of their skin. Everyone is the same it’s there skin color is different. In the beginning of the movie, it was obvious that there were two sides-black and white. As the characters began to know one another, they slowly began to unite as one side. The process from beginning to the end is not easy and it clearly shows us that anything is possible. The goal was to show us that working together with our differences can happen by, talking to someone of a different skin color and getting to know them. Setting back hundreds of years ago, everyone knows that racism has always been a big issue and for it to be mention in a movie in today’s society is good because it is very important and it will teach us we can work together despite our skin color.</p>
<p>The movie sets back in 1971 where racism was a problem in each individual’s daily life. The way that the African-Americans were treated definitely shows us that people did not care for them and were always mistreated. The choices that the people have made in the movie lets us know that the African-Americans were always the victims. In the movie, you see tension when Herman Boone movies into his new neighbor while everyone is staring at him like he doesn’t belong there. This incident in particular shows us that African-Americans were always the problem and is always targeting the African-American community.</p>
<p>As a citizen, racism still exists in today’s society. Although the movie has a happy ending, it is not always like that. People see this awful situation in films and in real life situations and would think that this needs to stop. The intended audience for this film is for everyone from kids to adults. There is no specific age group because anyone is welcome to watch this film that teaches a strong message about race. This film is for everyone because it states a clear strong message about racism that everyone should know about.</p>
<p>The genre of Remember the Titans is drama and of course, sports. Seeing from an African-American and white persons eye, you see how this becomes a historically big issue.  Racism which is a serious issue is portrayed as if you were living in that time because if you were living at that time period, you will know exactly how the characters felt. The problems that the African-Americans and the whites faced are something that is realistically true. At first, they will not like each other and respect each other. As they do get to know each other, they will slowly become friends. Realistically, in today’s society, it is not easy to get along with someone that has a different skin color. Due to the fact that racism has occurred many years ago, it will take a long time to be someone friend.</p>
<p>This film and the past which did experience racism clearly show that it is stoically factual. For example, there’s a scene where two different colored men becomes friends. Being friends, the white man introduces his girlfriend to his African-American friend. While introducing the African-American friend to his girlfriend, she hesitates and leaves him. Towards the end of the movie, the girlfriend accepts the white man’s friend and actually talks to him. This incident clearly shows that you can see this everywhere in today’s society. This scene in particular shows us that we are first hesitant to meet someone out of our own race but once we get to know someone, we are willing to try to get to know them.</p>
<p>Overall, this film shows us that we are the same person from everyone else. The only difference from each other is our skin color. This serious issue has divided the citizens in the United States. As we begin to move forward we are slowly beginning to undivided the like that has separated us for hundreds of years. Like the film, the beginning clearly shows us that there is hatred within the community but as they get to know each other every passing day, they slowly get along and become great friends despite the color of their skin.</p>

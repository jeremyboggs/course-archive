			<div class="entry">
				<p>History is studded with tales of great men who have achieved their enviable status. Some of these leaders have been excellent military leaders who have led their armies to the great victories. However, the total personality and distinctive behavioral traits of such men are not covered by historians  in some cases. One such military leader is Alexander of Macedonia. Historians have depicted Alexander’s life, relationship, and achievement as he conquered most parts of the civilized world before he died. <strong>The film “Alexander” sought to unveil the “real Alexander,” one who was not an immortal legend, but a normal human being who was subject to human desires, temptations and influences of others. </strong></p>
<p>The film began with a line borrowed from ‘The Aeneid’: “Fortune favors the bold.” The bold was exactly what “Alexander” turned out to be. The film took a bold and unheard of look at the life, relationships and achievements of one of history’s most charismatic leaders. “Alexander” can be classified as a drama, and more specifically as a biographical epic. The film aimed at a modern, civilized audience who will understand and appreciate an insight into the life of a great man in his ancient world habitat, its cities, people, armies and culture. Judging from the achievement of the film, the film had appealed to an international audience. “Alexander” did a commendable job capturing the entire life history of Alexander, from his youth to his obscure death, from his confusing relationship with his parents, and his jealous mother Olympias, to the enthusiastic bonds with his closest companions and his huge army. The historian Ptolemy narrated details of Alexander’s life that were not filmed, while Aristotle related the chronology of events.</p>
<p>“Alexander” attained the greatest level of historical accuracy by creating thousands of historically accurate dress and recreating the ancient world of Alexander. Also, armor specialist forged a huge collection of shields, helmets, swords, lances, bows and arrows. Especially, Alexander’s  double-plumed lion’s head helmet was impressive. Moreover, realism was instilled in the battle scenes drenched in bloodthirsty pomp. Graphic footage used in film depicted reality, too. Examples are the breathtaking aerial shot of the battle of Gaugamela between Alexander’s army and Persian troops, and the final vicious battle between Alexander’s army and Indian soldiers.</p>
<p>In keeping with movie’s premier aim to give audience a new insight into Alexander’s personality, the film dared to “bend” history in several places. The most important is Alexander being depicted as bisexual. Largely due to the advice of his father, Alexander perceived women as only required for the childbearing function. Obsessed with the ancient Greek warrior Achilles and his male lover Patroclus, Alexander preferred the after-hours company of men, particularly Hephaistion. The film depicted Alexander’s homoerotic love for Hephaistion. He professed his love to the extent of confessing, “I’m nothing without you.” There was no scene they actually kissed. However, their nuzzling head, chaste bear hugs, and soulful looks all served to point their love. Their sexual relationship was teased throughout the film.</p>
<p>The second “history bending” instance is the depiction of Alexander. Very unlike an expected stern hero who can do no wrong, Alexander was often moist-eyed and confused by events, especially those caused by his parents who use their son as leverage against the other. Philip warned his son that all women are evil, while Olympias insisted that Alexander was actually the son of God Zeus and not the Philip. Alexander witnessed Philip raping Olympias when he was a child. It made Alexander acted in similar vein. He raped his feisty Barbarian wife Roxane. Alexander was totally dominated by his adoring and ambitious mother. Much of his lust for power was credited to mother’s influence. She manipulated her son’s psychic strings, motivating and monitoring his activities even when hundreds of miles distant. Her influence even dictated Alexander’s wife choice.</p>
<p>The last “history-bending” consists of adding scenes that are not contained in Alexander’s historical records. These include Alexander’s athletic love foreplay with a naked Roxane, the rape scenes, and the homoerotic interchanges between Alexander and Hephaistion.</p>
<p>When compared to recorded historical event, the film raised many controversies. Iranian historians claimed many parts are historically incorrect. Firstly, Persians soldiers were shown undisciplined and not wearing uniforms in the movie, but in fact, they were very organized. Secondly, Alexander was shown defeating the Persian in a single battle, but in fact, he had to fight several battles before overcoming the Persian army. Scenes involving India too, such as the portrayal of Indian dresses, culture and idiosyncrasies, were totally inaccurate. Moreover, Muslim religious influences were shown in the movie was inaccurate. Islam had not yet been born at that time. The last controversy involves Alexander’s bisexuality - something most Greeks bitterly resent.</p>
<p>While Alexander’s legendary exploits have reverberated through history, he now re-lives in the film “Alexander.” Alexander is not only as a complex and charismatic leader who nearly conquered the whole world, but also as a realistic, much more understandable human being. By doing this, the film enables viewers to develop a deeper understanding into the personality of this legendary hero.</p>

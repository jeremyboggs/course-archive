				<p>As a kid growing up, the only inkling I have of any religious activity was when the family got together for holiday lunches and dinners and said grace before we ate. I never went to church, temple, synagouge or any places of worship really, but the times that I did, I was rather uncomfortable in the situation. Earlier on I believed that there was a god, and that whoever or wherever he was, he was looking out for me. As I began to get older and start to discover what religions held what characteristics, it seemed more to me that everyone of them had their own opinions and ideals, and if you didn&#8217;t agree with it you were going to hell. That was just a little bit absurd to me so I began to stray away from the thoughts of God. I began to debate if Religion was something created by man, to instill an undeniable fear in those that believed in it, in turn creating a way of control over a faction of people. It wasn&#8217;t for a while that I finally came to graps with how I actually feel. I believe that there is an actual God out there, I do not believe in Heaven and Hell, but rebirth of the soul. <strong>Religion is something that is a personal thought, something that if you believe in hard enough and you practice what you preach, then you are okay and you aren&#8217;t going to go to hell.</strong><br />
The stories of each religion are presented in a plethora of different ways, with different gods, different saviors, different bibles, and different beliefs, but it seems that all are working towards a unified goal, usually one of salvation or enlightenment. With so many options, how would one that had no previous religious knowledge know which to believe and which would actually lead them to their ultimate goal? How do we even know that what we are preaching is truly going to lead us to salvation, and that it wasn&#8217;t all just made up by some guy reading a special stone in his special decoder HAT!?</p>
<p>A real life example was recently by the Clock Tower of the JC. There is a gentleman that is constantly there that preaches his faith, not sure which one, but he sits there screaming off passages out of his bible. Who is he to say what he believes in is the correct faith. He even directed a statement towards me asking me if I had &#8220;accepted Jesus Christ as my Savior.&#8221; When I told him that I believe that there is a god out there that looks over all of us, he exclaimed that I was going to hell. My automatic recriprocation to his thought was, &#8220;Is anyone that doesn&#8217;t agree with you and your version of the bible, essientially going to hell?&#8221; His answer was a Stern &#8220;Yes, but I can still save myself, by accepting Jesus Christ in to my life and calling him my savior. It was at this point that I did not was to start a holy war and walked away.</p>
<p>I actually ended up going home and as much as I didn&#8217;t want to think about it, I kept replaying the situation in my head, over and over again. It was a few days later, that I finally came up with a paradox to his statement so to speak. If I recall correctly, A person who claims to be Aethist, is a person that does not believe in God, heaven, hell, or any of the usual religious proceedings. They believe that once a person dies, his body and flesh is recycle in to the earth, just like any other living thing. So technically here he would be wrong as of so far because while he is taught that Jesus Christ is his savior and Jesus will save anyone that belives in him. Well if Aethists dont believe in heaven or hell, then even if they dont accept Jesus Christ as their savior, where exactly is it that they go when they die? Can&#8217;t be heaven or hell because those two technically don&#8217;t exist in that persons mind or faith.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m ultimately trying to get at here is not debunking religion. I just believe that Religion has taken a stray road from what it may have originally been. Now a days its all about spreading your faith to those that do not know it, in order to convert them to your way of thinking. I&#8217;ve heard of stuff like that before, but it was rather difficult to understand because it was in GERMAN! It seems that Churches are now one of the biggest &#8216;business&#8217; schemes on the planet. Have you ever seen how lavish some of the churches that are being constructed these days are? I&#8217;m sure that god listens to the poor just as much as he does the rich, so what is the use of having golden angel fountains that spit water in to a pool? Does that allow the practitioners of that lavish church more liberties than those of less fortunate churches? If you have a strong belief if your own faith, than it shouldn&#8217;t matter if everyone else around you believes in it too. If you can&#8217;t see that than you might not be as faithful as you think.</p>
<p>This post was not meant to offend anyone or make fun of any religions, yet it is a touchy topic, so feel free to go rampant with comments. While I do not necessairly have a designated faith, I was raised under a Buddihst ideal by my father and mother. Personally, I am not a practicing buddhist, nor do I adhere to all of the paths to enlightenment that are set forth, yet. I do however try to instill some of the views and teachings in my everyday life. I believe in the teachings of reincarnation of the soul in multiple forms, let it be person, animal or and living species and that every living object has a soul. I don&#8217;t believe in killing anything unless it is for survival, let it be for food or protection. You never know if that hamburger you are eating was your uncle who may have passes away years before. Lastly,Â  Karma, it plays a huge role in our lives and screams that old saying &#8220;Do unto others, as you would like done unto you.&#8221;</p>

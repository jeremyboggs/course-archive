			<div class="entry">
				<p>The Confederate States of America was a name taken by six southern states. They withdrew from the United States government in 1860-1861 because they feared the election of Abraham Lincoln might lead to restrictions about slavery.  The first flag of the Confederate States of America was the Confederate flag which described a proud image of the Southern heritage. Over time, the Confederate flags acquired a range of meanings, contradicting one another. <strong>Since the end of the Civil War, the use of Confederate flags has stirred up much controversy because it is a sign that glorifies slavery and segregation.</strong></p>
<p><a title="Shelby Foote" href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/politics/jan-june00/flag_5-29.html">Shelby Foote</a>  is a supporter of the Confederate flag because it stood as a symbol of what his great grandfather fought for in the Civil War.  He states he is aware of the pain it may cause his African American friends, but feels they have an incorrect meaning and knowledge of confederacy noting:</p>
<blockquote><p>This country has two grievous sins on its hands. One of them is slavery - whether we&#8217;ll ever be cured of it, I don&#8217;t know. The other one is emancipation - they told 4 million people, you&#8217;re free, hit the road, and they drifted back into a form of peonage that in some ways is worse than slavery. These things have got to be understood before they&#8217;re condemned. They&#8217;re condemned on the face of it because they take that flag to represent what those yahoos represent as - in their protest against civil rights things (Foote).</p></blockquote>
<p>Foote believes that there is a misunderstanding for the confederate flag and honors it as recognition of our history.  Foote does not ignore that slavery existed in America; he acknowledges it as a “grievous sin”.  However, he believes that because of these sins, people use it as a means of defining the flag.  Furthermore, he sees it as a noble symbol that stood for much more than slavery.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cultural-expressions.com/thesis/confederate.htm">Alton H. Maddox Jr.</a> discretely opposes the Confederate flag flying atop of South Carolina’s state capitol.  He states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since Clinton is also the commander-in-chief, people of African ancestry should expect from him the same reaction if the flag of Nazi Germany were flying atop any state capitol. The federal military would invade the rebellious state and arrest the state&#8217;s top officials for committing treason.</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, he is saying that using the Confederate flag would be the same as agreeing to Nazi Germany’s communism.  Maddox’s reasoning is that “crimes against humanity were perpetrated under both flags”.  To sum up his argument, Maddox feels that the flag is a &#8220;relic of the past” with no moral or lawful reason for its existence.  Racism is clearly the biggest factor in his argument since African Americans have suffered from inferiority, noting “It is difficult to see this country elevate the rights of any non-citizen over the civil and human rights of its African citizens who are still uncompensated descendants of enslaved Africans.”</p>
<p>I agree with Maddox&#8217;s opposition for the Confederate flag because even though people may have misconceptions about what it symbolizes, it is most important to consider the perspective of African Americans.  We can not erase our history and the existence of slavery.  There are obviously people who hold the subject of segregation and inferiority in our past in great despair.  I am deeply concerned that this flag still is used today, seeing that there is so much controversy about it.  The problem is that the flag is displayed publicly.  We need to take into consideration that certain people are affected by our past in a negative way and being publicly displayed further reminds them of their hurtful past.  I feel the best solution would be for those honoring the flag to hang it in their homes less openly.  This way, the Confederate flag is not being destroyed; we are simply respecting how others may feel.</p>

			<p>I agree with you and the opinion of Maddox Jr. I see no real reason as to why the flag would be appropriate. I think that it definetly needs to be banned. Nothing good can actually come of it. Instead, allowing people to openly be able to display them will stir up a lot of hatred and controversy. At this point in the U.S., we do not need any more hostility then we already have. You argue that the flag &#8220;being publicly displayed further reminds them of their hurtful past.&#8221; I fully agree with you and it will have a negative impact. </p>
<p>I like the way you set up your paper. The fact that you have the two opposing views first and then your perspective and standpoint last makes it good. That makes it easy to follow your paper. Though I think that your paper lacked any sort of tranisitons. I think that the flow wasn&#8217;t quite right and that that kind of hurts your paper. I think if you added some transitions it would help make your post better. Good post!</p>

			<p>Good Post, I liked the way you set up the post with two differing opinions on the matter. I agree that the flag should be banned as well. I can&#8217;t imagine the pain or feeling that African-Americans get when seeing the flag and knowing that their ancestors were apart of that and treated so unfairly. I really don&#8217;t feel like it should be that big of a deal to take down the flag, it would probobly be deeply appreciated by the African-Americans in this country. While the confederate flag may still be flying today, I believe it&#8217;s a matter of time before it is taken down permanently, and rightfully so. This is a very tough topic, and I think you did a great job setting up the arguments.</p>

			<p>Your post is good. You brought in both sides of the argument and you stated why it is controversial. I don&#8217;t agree or disagree with the side you chose. I don&#8217;t think we should ban the confederate flag, I would have just hope people would have had the sense to not to slap the symbol on everything from bumper stickers to underwear. Technically, the Nazi swastika is not banned in the US, people just know not to brand it on everything. To bad laws can&#8217;t make up for common sense.</p>

			<p>This was a good post to read. You made good points why it is controversial and had two good arguments to the situation. I think you make a good point about how it shouldn&#8217;t be banned, but we should take in consideration of people that it bother before we choose to display it publicly. I really thought it was a good idea to display the flag in the confines of our own homes and places where it isn&#8217;t out in the public and people can&#8217;t get offended by it. </p>
<p>Even though I thought it was a good post and I enjoyed reading it, I thought that the structure was a bit scattered and could have been put together better. Just seemed off to me a bit. It didn&#8217;t flow right to me. I enjoyed it though. Good Post.</p>

			<p>You definately had a good post.  I really liked how you included the quotes from the various people on both sides.  That brought a lot of information into your paper.  However, I do not agree with you on this.  If we are goin to have to start taking down symbols that offend people, we would be left with nothing.  The cross that symbolizes Christianity offends people and yet that doesn&#8217;t get taken down.  What people need to learn to do is realize that symbols generally have dual meanings.  The Confederate flag means Southern pride and yes, once upon a time support for slavery.  The cross sybolizes the death of Jesus, and his resurrection according to the Bible which gives people hope.  There are always going to be symbols that offend people.  Yes, there will be some that offend more people more deeply, but we cannot just choose to ban those and not others.</p>

			<p>Your post is well written with few grammatical errors, and the articles you chose show both sides of your argument.  You made a statement about how it is important to consider the perspective of African Americans in this issue, and to that end I feel you should be aware of an event that occurred only a few years ago.  The Mississippi state flag has the southern cross in one of its corners and in the state decided to have a vote on weather or not to keep the flag this way or adopt a new one.  Well the Southern Cross is still in the Mississippi state flag because the African American population in Mississippi elected to keep it there, they feel that it is an important part of their heritage and of the history of the United States.  Furthermore the Nazi&#8217;s were not communists, they were fascists, they hated communists with a passion.</p>

			<p>I thought the post was good. Your ideas were very well-organized, and I liked how you had quotes from both view point instead of being one sided. But I do agree that the flag hould be banned because it&#8217;s a reminder of past that most want to forget. Unfortunately there will always be those who have hatred and anger towards other races.</p>
<p>Even though I really enjoyed reading it, There was some information that seemed quite hard to underdstand. And in the middle of the post some point were not mixed around that got me kind of confused. Overall well written post.</p>

			<p>Your post was informative by telling that why it is controversial, and I really like that.<br />
I think your post summarized two opposite editorials well. I liked the quotes from the both sides and it made me understand their ideas better. You had both side of the argument and it is a good thing in your post. I also agree with your view about displaying confederate flag. I think the flag should not be displayed publicly because we cannot deny that confederated flag is related to slavery and racial segregation. It might remind African-Americans their painful past.</p>

			<p>This is a well written post and I think that you take a very rational opinion on the matter.  You did a good job of finding two opposing opinions, however I feel the guy in favor of banning the flag seemed a little out of the mainstream.  I think by agreeig with him you are making a huge mistake, because this would be limiting a democratically elected legislature right to make their own decisions.</p>

			<p>There&#8217;s one big problem with your proposed solution.  You state that people should reconsider flying the Confederate flag in public places, however, you argue that when they fly it in their own homes, it shouldn&#8217;t be as open&#8230;that&#8217;s private property and people can do whatever they want as long as it&#8217;s not illegal.  I would imagine that Alton H Maddox Jr be opposed to the Confederate flag.  But he is just like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson that are look for small stuff that annoy his race.  Alton H Maddox Jr is an African American lawyer that has been disbarred.  The reason he was disbarred was because of his involvement in the Tawana Brawley case.  This case turned out to be a COMPLETE HOAX that ruined the life of a white police officer.  And how could he compare the Confederate flag to the NAZI flag?  I would never agree with a man that has this kind of history.  But brining him into your post shows that different perspectives that people have for this issue.  There are a lot of people out there that have their say in this controversy.  Some have a valid argument, while others are just crazy.</p>

			<p>I agree with your opinion, however I do not agree that people who choose to fly the flag should not do so outside if they choose. While it is hard to see for some, this is afterall America, and we cannot pick and choose what symbols people choose to represent.</p>
<p>I also think that Alton Maddox Jr. is absolutely wrong in saying the confederate flag is comparable to the Nazi flag. While slavery was awful and wrong, it is not all the confederate flag stood for, and the Southerners were not people who committed mass genocide. I think to compare these two is outright wrong and shameful.</p>
<p>Overall, good post and well supported.</p>

			<p>Good post! Very well written and easy to follow. Reading this post, I now realize how something so small that happened awhile back can spark up controversy. After reading this post, it made me understand how if really affect the people that see this flag on a daily basis. For the people who are against it, they are really hurt by this. The post author critiques this topic in a way where I understood the meaning of the confederate flag by summarizing the situation from both sides. What I like about this post is that the author included a summarize example from the editorial that states “he is saying that using the Confederate flag would be the same as agreeing to Nazi Germany’s communism.” I didn’t find anything that I disliked about this post. I somewhat agree and disagree on the post author’s point. With a serious situation like this, I think that you can either agree or disagree if you were living during that time. It means different things to so many different people. In order to choose a side, you have to be there physically. The post author summarized and critiqued the two editorials accurately by having summarize examples from the editorials.</p>

			<p>Your post was well written.  I don&#8217;t agree with it, but you were fair in stating your opinion along with the opposing. I have to disagree with the comment Maddox wrote. While the Confederate Falg stands for southern pride, the Swastika stands for well being. During the Nazi Revolution, they used the swastika, in a negative way just like the Klu Klux Klan used the Confederate Flag in a negative way. Beieving that the Swastika only represents the Nazis, shows complete ingnorance. We are still the United States of America. We are not divided like we once were, however, there still is much difference between the north and the south. The Confederacy lost, there is no doubt about that, however, we still have our pride. Why should we have to forfeit the pride of where we are from just because we lost? I am not saying that we should have won the war, I am saying we are proud of where we come from, and the Confederate flag represents it. Good Post!!</p>

			<p>Your post is very well put together. I like how you chose to elaborate and portray both sides of the controversy. This allowes one to be knowledgeable and pick a side if they wish. For me though, I am still undecided. There are good points for both sides. Ultimately if I had to chose, I would say that the confederate flag should not be banned, however, I do agree with you that one who wishes to display it should try to respect others and keep it in the privacy of their own home. However, while some are so worried about african american&#8217;s feelings, I must agree with Foote too. His great grandfather fought in the civil war and he should be able to be proud of his grand father. It would not feel good if someone said he was not allowed to have pride for his great grandfather. Maddox states that &#8220;It is difficult to see this country elevate the rights of any non-citizen over the civil and human rights of its African citizens who are still uncompensated descendants of enslaved Africans.&#8221; I do not feel that we/the government owes descendents of enslaved Africans anything. They were not directly affected and why does paying someone suddenly make it all better? But, since this is the case, why not compensate those who fought in the civil war like Foote&#8217;s great grandfather. Maybe if we pay someone to not fly the confederate flag they will be happy, but when we compensate descendents of slaves they are still not happy either. I do feel that Maddox has a very strong argument and I can agree with him when he compares flying the confederate flag to flying a Nazi flag. He is correct that &#8220;crimes against humanity were perpetrated under both flags.&#8221; But I still agree with Foote that it is a symbol of our history and if someone wants to display a confederate flag proudly I feel that they should because I own one too. A law stating it is illegal to show a confederate flag that is taking away our rights too.  </p>
<p>Your post was very informative. I learned why the confederate flag was created (6 states leaving the government) and it was interesting to hear both sides of the argument then your feelings and opinion. Your post stuck with your thesis and your post was well organized. The only thing missing was a closing, but I do see how it would be hard to make a closing, it would be a little repetitive since there is only two points really. Overall, excellent!</p>

			<p>Your opening paragraph provided a nice summary of the issue, and your thesis addressed why it was controversial. But, I would not have gone so far to say that the confederate states withdrew from the US only because of slavery reasons. Your evidence was also very clear and to the point, and showed both points of views equally, both with good arguments, before taking a side. Furthermore, I think it was very helpful that you included a portion of the article in your post because the reader is unlikely to read the entire article. This way, you picked out the most important part to read for us. </p>
<p>I wish that you had mentioned that many people share the views of Shelby Foote and Alton Maddox, especially because I have no idea who these people are and if they are credible. I agree that the confederate flag should not be flown over a state building, because not everyone can be happy with it, and not everyone can be proud of it. If the flag is going to be used, let it be the individual’s decision and not make choices for everyone. Overall, I think your post was very well done.</p>

I agree with both quotes, but I also don&#8217;t think we shouldhide away the confederate flag just because of some of the bad things it represents. It is an important part of US history. I feel that by hiding it, we are trying to erace that part of history</p>

			<p>As an African American, I have personal problems with the confederate flag. It has several different meanings and I think people should try to understand all of them. I agree with both opinion stated above. For someone to commemorate the flag as a symbol of their heritage is commendable. However, I do see it as a symbol of hate and oppression. </p>

			<p>Your post was very well written and I agree with you completely. I liked how you used to peoples different perspectives to compare and contrast them. I agree in you idea where you think that you should put them in a room or house so that they are less open to the public, everybody is different and everybody gets offended by different things but since we are all in america and americans we should satisfy the needs of everybody and if that means not displaying the confederate flag then so be it. Carrying and displaying the American flag could show just as much care for what a person went through in the past just like the confederate flag.</p>

			<p>This was overall a strong post, very well written. I felt that you had a very strong written thesis, however I disagree with it partially. I feel that if you were seeking to prove your thesis statement you did a poor job. It is true to say that when one sees a confederate flag, depending on the person you will get different reactions. The reaction of an African American citizen will be different than that of the Caucasions, or the Asians. I think that all persons perspectives should be taken into account, I agree with the first reference in your post, the flag should be used with common sense, as a sign of History and pride.</p>

			<p>I enjoyed reading your blog it is very interesing. The confederate flag represents opression and slavery. However thats not all it represents, it also symboizes the way of life in the south before the civil war. People see it differenty many see it as a bad thing, as i see it. America became what it is after the civil war, a free county with no oppression with rights for all. Good blog i enjoyed reading it.</p>

			<p>I think your post was well written and you supported your thesis quite well. It was good how you had two opposing sides of the story. Also you had a good amount of information about the controversy. The information you provided helped me in comprehending the topic better. I totally agree with you that the confederate flag should not be displayed because of the obvious reasons, I mean when you see it the first that comes to mind is the slavery and hatred of blacks. These were old values that we do not believe in now and it does not make sense for us to promote such things.</p>

			<p>I agree with your post, in that we cannot erase or forget our past, nor should the flag be displayed publicly. In displaying the flag privately, you came up with a sort of compromise; you&#8217;re giving the people with southern pride the right to praise their flag, while respecting others&#8217; opinions and being sensitive to their feelings at the same time. I applaud you for that.</p>

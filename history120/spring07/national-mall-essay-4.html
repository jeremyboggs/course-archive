				<p>The monuments and memorials of Washington DC tell a large story of our country’s past. As I visited the many memorials our city has I realized, almost all of our memorials are about war. <strong>These memorials symbolize the millions who have fought for our country so that their memory will live on.</strong> The memorials I chose were the Lincoln Memorial, Korean War Memorial, and the Roosevelt Memorial. These three I feel represent our country during some very important and hard times it has gone through. My theme for this project is obvious, but fits best. War and fighting, has been a reoccurring action in our country since it was founded. I believe that the majority of the wars we have fought have been for a good reason. The three memorials I chose symbolize how hard we fought for the freedoms we achieved and kept alive, by fighting in these wars. The Roosevelt Memorial doesn’t directly represent war, but it represents the hard times before World War Two and has quotes about Roosevelt’s feelings on war. It shows the agony our people went through during the Great Depression. It also praises Roosevelt for the extreme difficulties he went through while leading our country from a wheelchair. The Lincoln Memorial symbolizes what a great leader Abraham Lincoln was to be able to save the union and keep our country from falling apart. While doing that he was also able to emancipate the slaves. The Korean War Memorial observes the men who fought to protect democracy from being taken over by communism. It honors our men who helped keep communist North Korea out of South Korea. Our national memorials are here to honor our fellow Americans who bravely fought to make our country what it is today.</p>

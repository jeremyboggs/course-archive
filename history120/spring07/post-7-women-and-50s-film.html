			<div class="entry">
				<p>Throughout history, women have been characterized in many different ways, and unfortunately it is usually in a negative way. During the 1950&#8217;s, it was a popular stereotype that women were homemakers. Although this is not necessarily negative, many men expected this of their wives and women who did not fall into this stereotype were considered to be socially abnormal. Today a few different stereotypes permeate throughout our country, including women as purely sexual objects to women choosing to work neglating their families. Overtime, stereotypes may have changed but still do exist amongst women of today. <strong>The stereotypes of women have changed overtime from housewife to sexual objects, the main theme of  women being subservient to men has continued throughout the generations.</strong></p>
<p>While watching the video, &#8220;<a title="Cooking Terms!" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dOviPRMoyQ&amp;NR=1">Cooking Terms!</a>&#8221; there are many examples of the main stereotype women faced in that day and age as a homemaker. In the opening of the video, we are introduced to Tim and Margie, who are newlywed&#8217;s. Almost immediately we are introduced to the typical roles of husband and wife in the 1950&#8217;s; men went to work and women stayed home to cook. The video states, &#8220;The honeymoon is over for Tim now that he starts back to work. And it&#8217;s over for Margie as she enters her bright, new kitchen to cook her first meal. Yes, can she cook Tim&#8217;s favorite meals, just as his mother used to make?&#8221; The woman is expected to stay home and cook for her husband. Not only is she expected to cook for him, but also to make what he requests and up to his standards. In this scene, you can see how women were expected to please their husbands, with no real thought of themselves.</p>
<p>Another scene that promotes this idea of women being subservient to men occurs when Margie attempts to cook a cake for Tim. However, she misunderstands the cooking term to &#8220;cream&#8221; butter and the cake comes out wrong. The video states how Tim will be suprised and disappointed that Margie ruined the cake. Margie then appears in the scene to be very upset and worried that she cannot cook to please her husband. This is another example of the woman not doing something because she really wants to, but to please her husband. Because she incorrectly cooked the cake, her husband will be disappointed in her. You get the sense from this scene that because Margie cannot cook, she will not make a fit wife.</p>
<p>Finally, near the end of the video, Margie learns what all the terms mean and realizes there is a glossary in the back of her cookbook in case she has any more questions. The video states, &#8220;Now Tim will never have to know about how Margie ruined her first meal.&#8221; This statement again inforces the idea that a woman who cannot cook is regaurded as a failure in the eyes of her husband. The video even goes so far as to say this is one of the most important things you can do in your marriage and throughout your &#8220;career as a cook&#8221;. Therefore, obviously, you are not successful in your life as a homemaker if you cannot cook. These women were expected to please their husbands with their cooking skills and seemingly were considered failures if they could not do this task.</p>
<p>Although women today are not always expected to stay at home and cook for their husbands, there are still ways in which women are subjected to the idea that men are superior in status. For example, many music videos, especially from the rap industry, portray women to be purely glorified sexual objects, at the disposal of men. For example, in the Akon video &#8220;<a title="Smack That" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NInlZ1MnC0">Smack That</a>&#8220;, women are shown in skimpy clothing, dancing around for the men. Even the lyrics of the song are easily recognized as purely sexual, &#8220;Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Taebo/And possibly bend you over look back and watch me/Smack that all on the floor/Smack that give me some more/Smack that &#8217;till you get sore/Smack that oh-oooh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another example of women becoming subservient to men is in the workforce. Constantly there are stories arising of women doing the same work as men, however, they are payed less. Also, there are consistently lawsuits filed by women about being sexually harrassed by men in the workplace. One example of this is a video on YouTube entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGudma-ZY8o">Sexual Discrimination Educational Video</a>&#8220;. This video does a great job of showing things that typically happen to women in the workplace, except it tries to make a joke of the entire thing. The opening credits read, &#8220;How to deal with whiny women&#8221;.</p>
<p>Another scene shows a man (presumably the woman&#8217;s boss), greeting her by name and then smacking her on the butt. The narrator then comes in to tell what he did &#8220;wrong&#8221;, and explains you should not call a woman by her name, but instead refer to women in pronouns or verbs such as &#8220;you&#8221; or &#8220;move&#8221;. While this video may be intended for humor, it is these attitudes that continue to degrade women in today&#8217;s society.</p>
<p>As you can see, while stereotypes of women have seemed to evolve over time, I believe the main focus has continued over time. Women are still expected in many cases to answer to men, whether it is in the household or, today, in the workplace. It is unfair and unjust that this discrimination continues into the 21st century. A woman should have the option to do what she wishes, whether it is to become a stay at home mom, or a CEO of a corporation.</p>

			<p>You had a pretty good post. You wrote your thesis and backed it up well. But I found your “Sexual Discrimination Educational Video“ as a weak source for you to use because of it&#8217;s sarcastic nature.</p>

			<p>This was a well written post.  Your thesis statement was well written and was backed up by the body of your post.  I liked how you went into more detail than the other posts who used the &#8220;Cooking Terms&#8221; video.  It wasn&#8217;t just the cream in the batter or the words that needed to be looked up, it was also her facial expressions showing disappointment and what the narrarator said about her mistake and how she ruined the cake.  While I didn&#8217;t find it necessary to critique three videos for this post, all the clips that you presented were a vital part of your argument.  It is true that women in the work place are sexually harassed, but men are also victims.  The roles of women in the household and the workplace has changed tremendously since the end of World War II.</p>

			<p>I like that you brought to our attention about how women have changed, but are still looked inferiorly as sexual objects.  Your comment about the Akon music video stuck with me when I was reading your post.  I think it is a shame that women present themselves in an unprofessional manner.  This shows that this sexist stereotype of what it takes a woman to look sexy in our society can change if women do not follow it.  Women must take a stand, and understand that showing such provocative images on television can be harmful for other women.</p>
<p>I enjoyed reading your post, and you included many examples to support your thesis.  However, your post could have been improved if you were a bit more descriptive with some of your statements.  I felt like you ended them fairly quickly and jumped into another example, especially the second to last paragraph.  Overall, I enjoyed reading your post!  You did a great job!</p>

			<p>I think that your post was really good and I enjoyed reading it. I agree with just about everything you said. I think that women have, in a way, changed over time. Though I think that now we still view women as the housewife along with the fact that they are sex objects. Even though they have begun to change, it is still presumed that the women would do the housework and stuff like that. </p>
<p>It was a really well written post. You included a lot of specific examples and points that made reading your paper a lot easier and better. You did a good job of getting your points across. If I could criticize one point of your post, I think that you may have needed to put some of your examples together because they are making the same point.</p>

			<p>I thought your post was good and I enjoyed reading it until you tried to use a sarcastic video as a source. I mean, you did note that it makes a joke of it, but exactly it makes a joke, so why use it? To say &#8220;This video does a great job of showing things that typically happen to women in the workplace&#8221; is weak and a terribly gross exaggeration. I have held five part time jobs and not once heard of any female I worked with being sexually harrased. Sexual harrassment in the work enviornment is not a &#8220;common&#8221; thing and to make it out to be is, well, wrong. I don&#8217;t know what to think of your post. Yes, it was well written and you did support your thesis, but rarely are women smacked on the ass at work or told to &#8220;move&#8221; because of the fact that they are women. And until someone shows me a stat that shows things like that are in fact common I will continue to say that while it does happen, it is certainly not as widespread as you made it out to be.</p>

			<p>In response to your comment about sexual harassment of women not being widespread, there are statistics to show that 40-50% of women have experienced sexual harassment of some sort in the workplace. My point of the video was to show that while that was in fact sarcastic, things like this do happen and I believe making a joke of it is part of the problem. I agree with you I shouldn&#8217;t have used the phrase &#8220;typically happens to women&#8221;, but with statistics as high as 60%, I do not think it&#8217;s a &#8220;terribly gross&#8221; exaggeration.</p>

			<p>Your post is interesting and realistic. I completely agree with your thesis statement too.<br />
You did a good job of pulling examples from your &#8220;cooking terms&#8221; clip and pointed out interesting and evident points such as &#8220;Not only is she expected to cook for him, but also to make what he requests and up to his standards.&#8221; Also, that she is not cooking because she wants to, but because it is what she is supposed to do. It is her job to learn to be an excellent cook to therefore be the perfect wife.<br />
Your example of a rap video was a good choice as well since we can all pretty much relate to it and picture what you are saying. It also is very true. Women are depicted by the media as sexual objects and young men in society learn from it and treat real women in those manners. Also, women from both generations are expected to look nice. The woman in the &#8220;cooking terms&#8221; clip is dressed appropriately yet conservatively. It is accepted and slighty expected for a woman to dress provacatively in today&#8217;s society to be pleasing to men.<br />
I do not feel that the clip you chose &#8220;Sexual Discrimination Educational Video&#8221; was very good since it was sarcastic. It did however show what really does go on in work environments for women. Also, your closing could have been a little more detailed and not so condensed.<br />
I agree that the view of a woman has stayed the same in a sense. Women are allowed to have careers and educations but in a way they are still answering to a man. Women are typically not heads of companies and women are still the main ones cooking and taking care of their families. It is accepted for men to be stay at home dads but it is not typical.</p>

			<p>I dont agree with the part of the post where you said that women did things to please their husbands but not think of themselves, because to them getting dressed, looking all pretty and making their husbands happy was what they wanted. I do however agree that stereotypes might not be as bad as they were before but they are still there even though they have changed. Some people still believe that women are not set out to be able to do a man&#8217;s job. On the other hand the sexual things you were talking about I put the blame on the women. They do not have to accept being treated like that but sex now a days is such a cool thing to many people that they like it. Also sex is what sells products so the more it is put into products the better.</p>

			<p>Your post was written well, and it was very interesting. The two videos, “cooking terms” and “Akon’s music video” really support your thesis. Those helped me to understand your idea easily. Before I read your comment about Akon’s music video, I had not really noticed that women are portrayed as sexual objects nowadays. I have never thought about it in that way even though I have watched other similar music videos as “Smack that”. I agree with you that rap industry portray women as sexual objects, and I do not feel good about it. Women’s role changed overtime, and I thought that women’s social roles has improved tremendously. However, I realized that women’s typical roles has not really changed while I read your post; women are still responsible for housework and taking care of children.<br />
One thing that I did not like your post was “Sexual Discrimination Educational Video.” It is sarcastic and weak to support your writing. I know there are many women who experience sexual harassment, but I do not think it typically happen to women in the workplace.You also have some spelling errors.</p>

			<p>This was a good post and the clips did support the thesis.  The first video about the 1950&#8217;s and then to compare it with todays world with the song video.  The last video about sexual discrimination says that women usually have to work under men which i don&#8217;t think is true.  This is because women can make their own career path and climb their way to the top.</p>

			<p>What I like about this post is that the post author clearly supports their thesis by providing such evident information such as “As you can see, while stereotypes of women have seemed to evolve over time, I believe the main focus has continued over time. Women are still expected in many cases to answer to men, whether it is in the household or, today, in the workplace”. I also agree on the fact that women in today’s society are considered as a “sex symbol” which is kind of sad because not all women are like that. What I didn’t like about the post is that the grammar was a little off. Other than that, everything was fine. The author did support their thesis adequately.</p>

			<p>Your post was very good, I thought alot about this one. It is true that women are harrassed by some men, but mostly i think women get respected by most men. In all of my working experience I&#8217;ve never witnessed or heard of women getting sexually harrassed. Rap videos and rap in general is disgusting how they portray women and use them as &#8220;sex symbols&#8221;. However, they have auditions where sometimes thousands of women audition to be in these videos, so I don&#8217;t feel to bad for these women, they choosed to do it. I think supported your thesis very well and this was definitley one of the more interesting posts so far. Good Job.</p>

			<p>I liked your post, especially the concluding paragraph. Women should have the option to do what they want to in their life. They shouldn&#8217;t have to answer to anyone in society. I would like to add that although women today are still expected to answer to men, they choose not too and that is what makes them different then the women in the 50&#8217;s. Today’s women make decisions for themselves, and answer to no one but themselves.</p>

			<p>It was a really well written post, and I really enjoyed read your blog. I am totally agree with you when you said” The stereotypes of women have changed overtime from housewife to sexual objects, the main theme of women being subservient to men has continued throughout the generations.” Women really change a lot, they don’t just stay home take care her children they really want to do something in their life what they really want. You also add two video clips in to your blog to support your thesis, and that makes your post ever more interesting for reader to read. I think over all this is well done written and very good post.</p>

			<p>Your thesis makes an EXCELLENT point, which I whole-heartedly agree with.  BOTH the old view of women and CURRENT views of women are degrading.  I think what has really changed for the better is that women are able to take on jobs and roles now that would have been frowned upon before.  I hope that in the future, women are able to change their negative portrayals in pop culture.</p>
<p>You made a compelling argument for how things have not necessarily changed for the better, but I wish you could have mentioned a few more positive changes.</p>

			<p>You did a good job on your post and it was unique because everyone else’s arguments were focused on how much women’s roles have changed over time. I agree with you that even though some things have changes, there are still instances where women are subservient to men. This holds particularly true when you think of societies other than ours.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, I think you should have used a more serious video instead of the Sexual Discrimination video. Because it was a joke, I think some people will discard your point. Also, regarding your closing sentence, women DO have the option to do what they wish. There are many female CEOs, and our next president may even very well be a female. In the Akon video, even though your point is right how it gives a bad image for women, those particular girls in the video wanted to and chose to display themselves the way they did. Other than that, I think you are correct and your post makes a good point.</p>

			<p>I thought that your blog post was very accurate although not very imformative or original. I agree with you about the how women were used to keep there husbands happy as household wives. The movie was a time warp of sorts. I liked how you linked it to today and how degraded women are in cultural society. The sexual eduaction video was not good for your argument though becaue it was an obvious joke, but I do agree with you that even jokes can be harmful to how society perceives women.<br />
As for the original part, I feel like I already knew most of this. It would have been awesome if you found soemthing from either the 50&#8217;s or now that concreted your point further. I also think that you could have used the Don Imus story to convey your point further. I would have been brought in to your article further if it had drawn me in. The video was not so fun(I know you didn&#8217;t pick it, but it was so boring and long to sit through.</p>

			<p>I think you did a good job at proving your thesis. Also, you used some nice examples to get your point across. I think that had the video on sexual discrimination been made to be a real video it would have been a better example, but since it was obviously a joke it doesnt make your point as well.</p>

You could have choosen one example out of the film &#8220;cooking terms&#8221; to make your point. I still think that your post was very well written and overall very good.</p>

			<p>I enjoyed reading your post. I felt that it rang very true, especially the thesis. Women really are regarded as sex symobls these days instead of people. It&#8217;s strange how aspects evolve over time and how certain parts stay the way they are, while others change radically. You started alot of your paragraphs with &#8220;Another&#8221;, so it seems to get a little bland and repetive, think about finding a better way to split up your paragraphs so that it flows a little better. Good Job.</p>

			<p>Your post was extremely well written and easy to read and understand.  I really liked your thesis statement and how it was proven in your whole paper.  Your two videos were really good ideas and the explanation after each one of them really helped me understand what it was you were saying.  I also liked how your broke your essay into a bunch of paragraphs.  This is not always the right way to go but in this case it was.  I also like how you took the oposite to women and there ways.  Everybody tried to prove that women are almost equal&#8217;s today, but you took the other side of why women aren&#8217;t equal&#8217;s yet.  Nice job.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have to many critiques.  You could have had more counter-arguments of why women are improving there equal rights.  I just think that would&#8217;ve strengthened your post.  I really enjoyed reading it though.</p>

			<p>Your post was very interesting, i enjoyed reading it. You proved very good points and used good material to support them. The Second video about sexual eduacation was really funny however it made a good point. Great job on the blog it was very insightful and i enjoyed reading it.</p>

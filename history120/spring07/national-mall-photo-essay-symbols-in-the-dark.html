				<p>Washington D.C. Is America&#8217;s Capital. And because it is so, it is necessary that the city contain many honors to the great Americans who have shaped the country to become the great superpower that it has since our creation in 1776. <strong>Although they have created many memorials, such as statues, buildings, gardens, and fountains, the great monuments have much more symbolism than meets the eye.</strong></p>
<p><strong>         </strong>Lets begin at the Lincoln Memorial. What meets the eye is a sculpture of Abraham Lincoln. Simple Enough. But lets examine further. Look at his expression of his face. Stern and serious. Considering that Lincoln was a very serious man who endured much pain in his life, this seems fitting. THe lighting used creates an ominous view of the former President as if he was almost to be worshipped. The words behind him describe what kind of a President he was, while the giant panels of words to his left and right are words spoken by him. Although delivered over 100 years ago, Americans this day are supposed to view the words as symbols of a great America and live by these words and use them as a guide to live. Now, look at where Lincoln views from his seat. By looking out from his area, you can see the rest of the monuments out through the pillars. Just like he saw over the country when he served as president, the architects of the monument made sure he can still watch over the country today in symbol.</p>
<p>        Next up was the World War II memorial. The World War II memorial was by far the most complicated memorial we saw. Look at the way it is designed. Pillars, fountains, wreaths. There are more parts to this memorial than any other. And why shouldn&#8217;t there be. More people, not just Americans, were affected by World War II. Because of the amount of people affected, not just a single American, it is most fitting to be able to reflect as accurately as possible. Each pillar represents a state, such as Iowa, Utah, etc. The wreath placed on each states pillar represents an honor to the dead from each state. However, the states are not the only ones honored. America&#8217;s dependents, such as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, also have pillars. The dead of Europe are also honored with pools to reflect upon their dead, although they are not Americans.</p>
<p>      Lastly, there is the Washington Monument, the most famous of all monuments. Across from the reflecting pool, a long pool which can reflect the entire Washington Monument, and the lighting ensures that it is reflected at any time. This is a spot that was popular for protests because it is a place where Americans are supposed to go to reflect on their own lives and duties of Americans. Some like what they see, some do not. Then comes the tall white structure. Although it does not serve any type of true purpose, it is still extremely symbolic. One symbol that I believe I found is the uniform design. Every side is the same, smooth, simple, no decorations. I believe this is because all accounts of Washington as a man was simple and consistent, much like the monuments design. The Washington monument is also, by rule, the tallest structure in D.C., because Washington is the most important figure in our history. Also surrounding the monument are 50 American Flags, one for each state in the country, none of which would exist without George Washington.</p>
<p>      All these monuments are so full of symbols that most people do not realize. The architects and planners clearly had an idea that often go unnoticed. The National Mall is a great spot to go to explore symbols in American structure to honor our greatest heroes. Hopefully, this small essay did something to help open your eyes to the symbols you may have not noticed before when you visit the National monuments of Lincoln, Washington, and World War 2.</p>

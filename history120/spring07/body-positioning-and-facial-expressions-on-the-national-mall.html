<p>The National Mall houses some of the most important and influential people and events throughout all of the American history. Millions travel there each year and can expect to see monuments from George Washington to memorials for events such as the Vietnam War. As many go to visit these attractions, none of them ever stop to think why the statues are placed in that specific way. Though when all things are considered, there is significance to every aspect of the statue right down to the reason the feet are spaced out the way they are. <strong>On the National Mall, our perceptions of historical figures can be seen through just looking at the body, positioning and facial expressions of the statues themselves.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Through an in-depth look at the statue of Abraham Lincoln, a tourist can learn information even if they did not know who he was or what he did. For example, by just looking at Lincoln’s feet you can infer a lot about him. The positions of his feet give you a look into the two sides of Lincoln. One of his feet is placed so that it is coming off of the platform of the chair, so that it appears to be dangling off. Through this we can see that people, at least the sculptor, saw that Lincoln faced problems head on and that he was always ready to “spring into action.” While the other foot is seen to be rather stiff and parallel to the back of the chair. This helps to show his stubbornness and inflexibility. At the same time, you are able to see clear-cut spacing between his two legs and feet. This helps to show that we see him as a person who doesn’t like to mix his two personalities; that you cannot get two comfortable with his eagerness or with his firmness. It shows that he is a changing man that is unpredictable. Lastly, through the clenching of his hand, we are able to also infer something. His hand shows his need for power and control. It allows people to see that Lincoln was always in command and got things done how and when he wanted to.</p>
<p>By taking a look at Franklin D. Roosevelt’s statue we are also able to get a look into whom he was as a leader and as a person. The fact that he has all his body weight shifted to one side of the chair shows us a look into his readiness and eagerness to fight the hardships and make a difference. As well though, there is a clear distinction between his body. On one side, we are able to see his leg and his two arms. Though on the other side, everything has been hidden by his cape. The positioning of the cape to hide half of his body gives us insight into our perception of Roosevelt. Through this we can see that the people felt that he was trying to hide something. It is as if there was something that he didn’t want anybody to know. This could either be related to his illness, or his methods in fighting the depression. Lastly, the positions of his arms, one on top of the other resting on the arm chair, shows us that he was a very relaxed leader that took events calmly and resolved them with concentration and understanding.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson’s statue is unlike many of the other statues on the mall. Most of the statues depict a man who is sitting down, while his statue is standing straight up. As well, his statue is rather large with him looking extremely tall. The fact that he is standing and the largeness of the statue gives the tourist a sense of just how significant he was and how significant we think he is. It makes it a point to portray him so tall to that you “look up” to him. This allows people to see that his achievements and accomplishments were ones that are hard to emulate. It gives us a sense that Jefferson was “larger than life.” This could be a result of the fact that we hold very sacred the Declaration of Independence and view the writer a very important man. Like Lincoln, Jefferson can be seen with one hand formed into a clenched fist. Again, this shows his power and need to be in control and in charge. Lastly, Jefferson can be seen with his leg bent and one of his feet placed a little farther out. This again shows his willingness and ability to take action when necessary. It also lets people know that he has a softer side. That he is not “all work and no play.” It gives a sense that there is a side of Jefferson that is more relaxed and capable of being unstressed.</p>
<p>Lastly, when you look at George Mason’s statue on the Mall, you are able to learn about things you may have otherwise not known. For example, Mason is positioned so that he is relaxing and kind of leaning to one side. This helps show how his importance is somewhat limited. Unlike the other statues, such as Lincoln or Jefferson who are seen very stiff and unmoved, Mason is more leaned back. This may be because he was not a president and is not as significant as the others in our eyes. In one of his hands though he is holding a book open with his fingers. This shows his intelligence and knowledge. We are able to see just how important, mentally, that Mason was to the growth of America. To also re-enforce his intelligence Mason’s face looks as if he is starring into space pondering his next big idea.</p>
<p>Mason, Jefferson, Roosevelt and Lincoln, what do they all have in common? Each can be found sitting or standing on the National Mall in D.C. Upon first glance, most people would notice things such as the books next to Mason or the dog next to Roosevelt. Though when you really look at the facial expressions of the statues or the way the body and its parts are positioned you are able to learn so much about the person. The four statues of the four men all have one thing in common: they are all perceived by people to be intelligent, powerful and unforgettable.<br />

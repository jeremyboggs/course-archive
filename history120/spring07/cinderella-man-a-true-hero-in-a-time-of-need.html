				<p>      Movies are just one avenue people use to escape from the everyday grind of their lives and just sit back and relax. Movies that are factual based give people of today the opportunity to understand how life was in historical times without actually being part of it. For example, movies about such events as the Great Depression, times of war, and tragedy such as the sinking of the Titanic help us understand how people coped and reacted during times of great challenges. Cinderella Man, for instance, is a movie that took place during one of the darkest times that America has faced and how one man rose to the occasion and made a life better for everybody came in contact with. Jim Braddock, a once promising boxer is forced into retirement after a couple of key losses. Entering the darkest times of the Great Depression, Braddock luckily gets a job working at the docks to support his family. Thanks to a last minute cancellation, Braddock is given a one time and one time only fight against the number two light heavyweight boxer in the world. In contrast to everyone expecting Braddock to lose in the first round, he beats all the odds and knocks his opponent out shocking the nation. This win and subsequent others gets Braddock a title shot against Max Bear, the heavyweight champion of the world. Not listening to the advice of his friends, kids, or even his wife, Jim Braddock undergoes one of the most painful fights he has ever faced. In the end, even though he was badly beaten, he was named the heavyweight champion of the world. <strong>&#8220;Cinderella Man&#8221; is a feel good movie that depicts America during the great depression and how one man&#8217;s endurance, integrity and family values overcame insurmountable odds</strong>.<br />
      Cinderella Man does an excellent job of depicting what life was like during the Great Depression. It shows us that under extreme hardships and bumpy times, there’s always good that can come from it. The message of the film is that no matter how tough things appear to be, if you keep a positive attitude and keep trying, eventually good will come out of it. In the movie, Jim Braddock describes this attitude clearly when he says, “I have to believe that when things get bad, we can do something about it.” Fighting with a broken arm, giving the small amount of food he had to his children, and working on the dock’s in danger of getting injured all were sacrifices that Jim Braddock didn’t have to take, but took it anyway to support his family and their needs. The times of the Great Depression were extremely tough and even though Jim Braddock had thousands of reasons to give up and die, he kept fighting and eventually got rewarded for it. As the movie went on you could tell the rewards he was granted. The beginning of the movie gave us great examples of how rough the times were. Their house was really small with only a bed or two, they ate one piece of ham for their meal with watered down milk, and they even stole wood from fences to make fires. It got so hard that Jim actually went onto welfare for money so he could get the electricity turned on and his kids back. The movie did such an excellent job of putting the audience in the moment, that you almost felt guilty sitting there eating popcorn and drinking soda while watching Braddock’s family eat very little. As the movie progressed, and Jim made some money, you could see how the times got better. The electricity was turned back on, they had full meals, and Jim even had money to buy his wife flowers.<br />
      The biggest choice that this movie made was to show how bad the Great Depression was and how people had to overcome adversity. They chose to make Braddock live in a very dark and dismal building with no education and a rough and tough personality. They made his manager look like a non-caring person who only thought about himself. This was demonstrated when the manager was making Braddock fight even though he was hurt, he kept pushing him to fight, and even was a big influence on him to fight Max Bear. They chose him to work at the Dock’s to show how hard it was to get a job and to get money in these times. They could’ve shown this movie in a thousand different ways, but they decided to show how bad the Great Depression actually was through the many details it showed us. The movie also did an excellent job of showing the great disparity that was apparent during this time between the rich and poor.<br />
      This action packed dramatic film is intended for anybody who has ever heard about or lived through the Great Depression in America. Many people who have ancestors that lived through the Great Depression get a good look at what actually occurred during those times. People who learn about the Great Depression in school can watch this movie and relate to it as well. This movie is very accurate to the details and styles of that era. The clothes, old cars, beat up boxing gloves, and boxing ring excellently portrayed the time period. Although this movie falls into the boxing genre like a Million Dollar Baby and Rocky, it was able focus more on the struggles of John Braddock and the times then on boxing. During one of his interviews, Jim Braddock stated, “this time I know what I’m fighting for.” Even though he said he was fighting for milk, he was also fighting for our nation and the people who had suffered through the Great Depression. He was fighting for everything he believed in and I believe that was the main reason he took the fight that potentially could have ended his life. <br />
      Although the movie was very accurate conveying both how the people looked and survived during the great depression, it did take some liberties with details. An example of this is how the movie depicts Max Bear as killing two people in the ring before the big fight, but many historians, including members of Bear’s family, have stated that the second person did not die as a result of his injuries sustained in the ring. The other scene that could be a stretch on actual events was how Jim and his wife reacted during the party thrown for them before the main fight. It was a very expensive restaurant with many wealthy people in attendance. Jim and his wife were depicted as being able to handle that type of scene when in fact they probably couldn’t have given where they were in the social ladder.</p>
<p>      Cinderella Man was truly a great movie.  The ability for one man to rise a nation in a time of need of desperate need it just remarkable.  Jim Braddock was a hero of all ages and will always be remembered not only as a great boxer, but as a person who changed our nation.  Cinderella Man changed my view on the Great Depression.  At first, I just thought it was a normal thing and America was faced with adversity like we always were.  After watching the movie, I can truly feel how bad the Great Depression was and what the people of their time had to go through.  This movie had the impacts of the Great Depression, while having a marvelous story behind it, which made for one hell of a movie.                                                  </p>

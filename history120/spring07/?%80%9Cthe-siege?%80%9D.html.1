			<div class="entry">
				<p>“The Siege” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Siege">(Movie Info)</a> includes an all-star cast of Denzel Washington and Bruce Willis, the same actors we loved in “Man on Fire” and “Armageddon.” Islam is one of the fastest growing religions and has been a controversial issue for many years. Terrorism as well has become a very hot button issue. What do these topics have in common? “The Siege” is a movie based around the issues of terrorism and Islam. <strong>The movie is highly offensive to the Muslim religion, as it does not do a good job of distinguishing terrorism from Islam.</strong></p>
<p>The movie begins by setting up what seems to be the basis of the movie, terrorism. The U.S. takes an Islamic leader captive and brings him to America, setting off the string of terrorist attacks that soon arise in New York City. As made evidently clear throughout, the movie was made as a way to make Americans aware of the “what-ifs.” In a way, it is preparing them if anything like this may ever happen and what they should hope to see if it ever did. As well, it seems that it was made to show how terrorism and Islam are very much intertwined. As a result, the intended audience is obviously Americans. It is stirred more to the elite, older generation of Americans who know a thing or two about Muslims and are aware of world issues. This is based around the language used that is rather a little more upper level with some education needed to fully understand the entire movie. It definitely plays on the emotions of the audience. For example, there is a scene that shows the aftermath of a terrorist attack on a filled movie theatre. As the camera takes us through the theatre, we are exposed to many dead bodies as well as still living people who lost body parts they will never get back. Here, the American audience is awed and sorrowful to see what could happen to them and their tolerance toward Muslims is slowly deteriorating. </p>
<p>The movie is drama filled with action pact scenes that do a good job stirring up feelings of hate and sorrow. For example, there is a scene on a bus with a lot of little kids along with terrorists who are carrying bombs and are threatening to kill. All you can hear is the screams and moans of the children as they are terrified for their lives. Who would not be ready to run out of their house and throw all Arabs and Muslims into internment camps? Children are unquestionably a symbol for innocence and as human beings we would be horrified for anything to ever happen to them, whether they be a daughter, son, niece, nephew, or even not be in anyway related to us.</p>
<p>The U.S. should be protected and secured at all costs, no matter whom it affects, is the point of view of the movie. This is shown through the portrayal of creating internment camps in which Arab and Muslim young male adults are taken away from their families and forced to stay. Internment Camps? Weren’t we regretful for putting the Japanese in internment camps <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_American_internment">(Japanese Internment Camps)</a> during World War Two? How can we then justify putting Arabs in internment camps, even if it is just in a movie? Yes, there are terrorist, but at what cost are we willing to risk the freedoms of Muslim citizens to secure security?  It is not to say that the movie portrayed internment camps that were as bad as the Japanese, but it is still wrong and inhumane. For most of the characters in the movie, this internment camp is an acceptable action to take and is viewed as the only way to secure the safety of the American population as a whole.</p>
<p>My “favorite” part of the whole movie would have to be the last scene. Here we are, with a Muslim terrorist who is figured to be the “last cell.” We watch as he prepares to do his “duty.” The most interesting thing is what he is engaging in doing throughout the scene. Americans get to watch as he initiates a Muslim ritual of cleansing the body that is done before every prayer. When the scene first begins, it is just the “last cell” and a detective who had been helping him. She watches as he does his preparations unaware of what was to come. He explains to her that, “There will never be a last cell,” as Denzel and his partner come rushing in, only to interrupt. The scene ends with the demise of the “last cell” and the detective as well. The fact that this is placed within the movie makes it extremely hard for Americans to distinguish between Muslims and terrorists. As well, the fact that it is the last scene makes it even more unforgettable as the last scene, if any scene, is the scene that viewers never forget. In a way, it is setting a tone that all Muslims are terrorists, which is obviously historically wrong. How come the terrorists could not have been American? Or of any other race or religion than Muslim or Arab?  For decades Muslims and Arabs have been known to be “terrorists” and to be feared.</p>
<p> I am not saying that terrorism is not an important harmful act that we should just ignore or not worry about. It is undeniably something that questions our security. Though movies like “The Siege” does a good job at portraying the history of Arabs and Muslims in countries like America. So within the movie we can pick out parts that are historically correct and parts that are historically incorrect. Their portrayal of Muslims being classified as terrorists has been true for many decades. As for the fact that all Muslims are terrorists is completely wrong.  “The Siege” does a horrible job at trying to distinguish the difference between a Muslim and a terrorist and instead makes the line even murkier for Americans.<br />

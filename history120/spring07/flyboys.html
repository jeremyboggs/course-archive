				<p><strong>Introduction  World War I </strong></p>
<p>World War I had many names, the first world war, the great war, “the war to end all wars.” It was a world wide military conflict of many big nations all through Europe which took place between 1914 to 1918. This war killed millions and left many more separated from families and homes. The countries were divided into two fractions, the Central powers who were trying to take over most of Europe and the Allied powers who were trying to stop this from happening. The Central powers consisted of Germany, Austria-Hungry, and the Ottoman Empire. The Allied powers consisted of United States, France, British  Empire, and Russia. With this war came many new inventions, one being the just recently invented air plane. It didn’t take long for the military to realize that these planes could be utilized as a very useful war weapon. The United   States entered the war late, however there were still many brave Americans coming to volunteer their services all over Europe. One place being France where they had started a fighter squadron for Americans called Lafayette Escadrille.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;FLYBOYS&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>The movie “Flyboys” was a well anticipated movie for fans that enjoy aerial combat and dog fights. <strong>Although this movie had incredible visual effects and outstanding action sequences, it lacked to tell the true story and historical facts of World War I. </strong>The movie had many well known actors to light up the screen and attract fans. Dazzling would be the word I would use to describe the aerial battles that took place as the American pilots fought the Germans high in the sky. The visual effects were great and expected since the same guy directed Independents Day. You could say that the visuals were a little excessive, since smoke trails like missile fire followed the small little bullets from the machine gun. I guess they had no other way for you to follow the bullets to the enemy planes.</p>
</p>
<p>The characters were all given supporting roles with the exception of one, Blain Rawlings played by James Franco. You see the story through his eyes as he deals with dilemmas on the ground and in the air. He must leave his home after defaulting on the payments and having a bench warrant for beating up the banker tried to take his ranch. Blain Rawlings is portrayed as fearless hotshot cowboy looking for thrills. He is a wild man with no respect for authority and does as he pleases. The audience is forced to like him since he is a man who just lost his home and forced to run because of an “evil banker”. History goes to show you this behavior would not be tolerated, as the French ran one of the most rigid outfits in the war. He also leaves the base a number of times to visit the French girl he falls in love with. Again this would not be allowed at war time for a pilot to leave in the middle of a war and visit with his girlfriend. Instead of the movie focusing on the fighter pilots and there missions, much of the movie focused on this love affair.</p>
</p>
<p>Historically speaking there was no information given about the opposition. Only mentioning the Germans and not once mentioning the rest of the Central powers. The purpose for this movie was to allow viewers to see the very first combat fighters in action and to understand the technology that was available to them. I believe Flyboys did not show the movie with correct factual evidence. The plane shown in the movie looked like it was made of fiberglass, nice and spotless with a flawless engine. However history will tell you that the plane was made out mostly metal and wood with really high crash rate. The Germans were portrayed as evil people with so sense of remorse of honor. Most of the Germans were in red planes taking cheep shots and shooting Americans fighter pilots who had ejected or crash landed on the ground. The showed the leader of the enemy as the “Black Falcon”, a brutal commander of the German squadron fighting against the Americans. He was portrayed as ruthless with no mercy, toying with some of the inexperienced pilots letting them know before he would shoot them down. The Black Falcon was symbolized as an evil man flying a terrifying all black plane with more fire power than the Americans. Now this is not a video game where you face the boss at the end of the level, although this movie was shown as if it were. There were no rouge fighter pilots on either side who just flew around shooting down what they saw. These planes had a limited amount of fuel and could fly their missions and hopefully make it back to the base.</p>
</p>
<p>This movie had really good visual effects and I enjoyed the story line. I do not believe it showed factual evidence to support what really happened in the war. The planes were not portrayed correctly, and the enemies shown as heartless butchers. The main character Blain Rawlings was shown as an out of control wild cowboy with no respect to authority. Although this makes the movie more interesting, this would not happen in the French military or any other military. Overall I enjoyed they movie and categorize it as a fiction movie with no relation to the real war.</p>

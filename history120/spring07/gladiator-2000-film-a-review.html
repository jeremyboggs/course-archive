				<p>     When considering historical movies, there are many aspects that effect how the history is portrayed. One of the most influential aspects that effect the portrayal of history is the need to satisfy the audience that is being targeted. Since the goal of big budget blockbusters such as <em>Gladiator</em> is to make as much money as possible, the movie must appeal to a wide range of viewers, and therefore must be careful with the delicate balance between factual accuracy and entertainment. There are those who want to be entertained regardless of whether it is true, which comprise the majority of people in this day in age, and there are those who believe that historical accuracy should not be compromised for the sake of entertainment. In order to satisfy both of these audiences, the filmmakers of <em>Gladiator</em> must consider their stylistic approach, the point of view in which the story is told, and the historical accuracy of the film, which in turn all effect how the history of Rome is portrayed. </p>
<p>     The movie, <em>Gladiator</em> (directed by Ridley Scott), begins when Maximus (Russell Crowe), who is one of Rome’s greatest generals, wishes to return home to his family after a grueling victory over the Germanic barbarians. But contrary to his wishes, Maximus’ father figure and current Emperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius, tells him that he has been chosen to be the next Emperor in place of the actual heir, Commodus. Aurelius believes that Commodus is not fit to be the protector of Rome, nor will he fulfill his wishes to turn Rome back into a Republic. Upon being informed that Maximus will take the throne, Commodus murders his father Marcus Aurelius, and then orders his men to execute Maximus. Maximus escapes death only to be captured to become a slave, and later traded to become a Gladiator. From here, Maximus rises amongst the ranks of gladiators, and as his master’s wealth grows, he finds himself fighting in Rome’s Coliseum before Commodus himself. Finally, after many perilous struggles, Maximus has a showdown with Commodus in which he has the chance to revenge the death of Marcus Aurelius and set his dying wishes for a Republic in motion. </p>
<p>     Since a major goal of this movie is to appeal to a large audience, a lot of focus needs to be put on making its style entertaining. Using the fascinating setting of Rome, <em>Gladiator</em> is incredibly pleasing to the eye. The cinematography in this film is breathtaking, specifically the digitally rendered backdrops of ancient Rome and its Coliseum, which provides the audience with a satisfying and almost magical impression of the Rome that would make one wish to have witnessed it first hand. The most memorable scene in which Rome is digitally interpreted, is when Commodus considers the fate of his sister while on his balcony that looks over the vibrant and massive city. In this scene, as well as several others, historical records and current artifacts are used to recreate ancient Rome in a glorified way. In doing so, the way in which Rome is portrayed emphasizes its strength and greatness.  Also, by making interpretations using some factual basis, the producers are able to stun both those who are simply seeking entertainment as well as those who are intrigued by the history of ancient Rome.</p>
<p>     In another attempt to grab the interest of mass viewers and those of us with short attention spans, <em>Gladiator</em> is comprised mostly of action sequences.  Because the special effects, as well as the acting by Russell Crowe (Maximus), were so impressive, the Roman army seemed to be as powerful as I previously envisioned it to be. Even in Maximus’ battles as a gladiator, his heroic victories represented the strength and composure of the Roman Army that he had previously commanded. Also, as a consequence for having more action, there is a limited amount of dialogue throughout the film. While many past movies about Rome are heavy in dialogue often considered hard to follow, this was the filmmaker’s decision to make it possible for almost everyone to understand without it being boring. </p>
<p>     Another interesting aspect of <em>Gladiator</em> is that it is told from several points of view as Maximus is reduced from a high-ranking general to a gladiator. This is unique because most movies about ancient Rome are portrayed from one point of view, usually the emperor’s. This is appealing to a large audience not only because people think unique is good, but also because people have the tendency to love the underdog. In the beginning of the film, we are able to see through the viewpoint of Maximus as a general, where the majority of characters are used simply as tools to create an epic battle scene. Here, the only characters that matter are the people in power, which allow us to appreciate the combat strategies and sheer power of the Roman Army. By having Maximus lose his commanding power, we are able to gain some insight on what the lives of ancient Roman slaves and gladiators were like, mainly through Maximus’ interactions with Juba, a fellow slave and gladiator. Juba was introduced into the film by helping Maximus with a wound, and as the film proceeded, Juba shared his personal emotions about his love for his family. By portraying the movie from point of view of Maximus as a slave, not only are we able to realize that slaves too have feelings and loved ones, but we are also able to see the flaws of the Roman culture by witnessing the agony that slaves and gladiators were put through. From these two points of view alone, two sides of the history of Rome are portrayed. On the other end of the spectrum, in some scenes we are able to look through the eyes of Commodus, the emperor who only saw slaves as money and gladiators as entertainment. But, having previously experienced the point of view of the gladiators, we, the audience, have their sympathy and are able to recognize that Commodus’ view is an evil one. Essentially, by experiencing the point of view of the slaves/gladiators, the audience was able to recognize the flaws of Commodus. This is important because even though Rome visually appears to be impeccable, the movie is able to portray the historical truth that Marcus Aurelius was the last of the “five good emperors”, while the deranged Commodus scandalized Roman society. </p>
<p>     In addition to the appealing stylistic elements and interesting points of view, there are many historically inaccurate elements to this movie. They may not be very good for attracting and pleasing history buffs, but these inaccuracies enhance the dramatic story line of the film, which is satisfying to the masses of people seeking entertainment. One example of this is that although his son Commodus was with him at the time of his death, Commodus never murdered Marcus Aurelius in order to seize the throne. In fact, Aurelius, who died in 180AD, named Commodus Caesar in 166 and made him co-emperor in 177. Although this may be a deterrent to history buffs, the revenge that that Maximus seeks would have been significantly less personal and/or meaningful. Commodus murdering Marcus Aurelius was the point at which Commodus was defined as the evil character, and the point at which the audience was given a reason to want Maximus to succeed in his revenge. </p>
<p>     Another historical deviation occurred during the beginning of the movie when Maximus’ forces were at battle with the Germanic Tribes. The way in which the Roman Legionnaires abandoned their formation to engage in Hollywood friendly one-on-one standoffs is historically inaccurate in that they would never do this unless retreating. Historically, the way that the legionnaires stuck together, holding formation and aligning their shields to create barriers was what made them so successful in combat. In a one-on-one battle against a Germanic barbarian, the barbarian would almost certainly be the victor. The creators of the movie decided to make this battle scene less historically accurate with the intent to make it more entertaining to watch, and therefore attract a larger viewer audience. Even though the history of Rome was bent in some instances, the movie was nonetheless successful in portraying the overall essence of the time period. </p>
<p>     As one can see, in pursuing the goal of <em>Gladiator</em>, which was to appeal to the largest audience possible, many decisions were made that effected how the history of Rome was portrayed. The most important of these decisions were in regards to the stylistic approach, the point of view in which the story is told, and the historical accuracy. Yet, these are not the only elements of the film that define how the ancient Roman history was portrayed, and although appealing to the masses was a higher priority than appealing to our fellow history buffs, the end result of <em>Gladiator</em> was a wonderful story that portrayed the time period very well.  For those who are looking to learn the hard facts about ancient Rome’s history, I suggest that you rely on sources other than this film. With that being said, for the rest of you who are willing to accept a few historical inaccuracies for the sake of entertainment, I highly recommend that you watch this movie.  </p>

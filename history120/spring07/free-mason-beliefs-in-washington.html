			<div class="entry">
				<p>Freemasonry is something that has been around for many centuries. It has been around from the early Egyptian times, to the Knights of Templar, to the Founding Fathers or our country, and still today by many people. Freemason teaching is associated with geometric figures and shapes, symbols and signs, astrology, and great empires from the Egyptian and Greco-Roman times. Many of the founding fathers, from George Washington to Benjamin Franklin who helped make up our government and build of capital were Masons. <strong>Our founding fathers free mason belief led to the way our nations capital was built and the way we see it today.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>            </strong><a href="http://www.earthstation1.com/EsotericaFiles/Pics/Masonic/TN_Square&amp;Compass.jpg">    The Masonic square and compass</a> is something that you can find in the layout of Washington D.C. A lot of people will tell you that it is just a coincidence, but it is to much of a coincidence to be overlooked and the facts that support it are to hard to overlook too. The Masonic square and compass is the main symbol that is used in mason teachings today. You can find the Masonic square and compass by taking the capitol building, the white house, Lincoln memorial, and the Thomas Jefferson memorial. In this <a href="http://maps.mapnetwork.com/dc/wctc/index.asp">map</a> if you draw outlines starting at the capitol building to the White House and use Pennsylvania avenue for the left leg and the white house for the left leg to stand on then use Maryland avenue as the right leg and the Jefferson memorial for the right leg to stand on for the leg on you will see the outline of the Masonic square and compass. I chose to write about this because it is one of the main symbols that can be seen in the layout of Washington with reference to Mason beliefs. The most interesting part of all of this is the Jefferson memorial. It sits off to the right and away from most of the main part of Washington D.C. Out of all the places to build a monument it was built where it is. The Jefferson memorial is one of the newer monuments in D.C. It was proposed by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1934. What makes this interesting is that Roosevelt was a mason. So even though this could all be a coincidence it really is too much of a coincidence that the person who suggested this was a mason and it completes the design of the Masonic square and compass. So as much as expects and historians want to dispose of this, its hard to overlook because there are so many facts to support it.</p>
<p>The Federal Triangle which can be seen with the map provided in the above paragraph is made up of Pennsylvania Avenue, Constitution avenue, and 15<sup>th</sup> street. It can be extended to include the White House, Washington monument, and the Capitol building and that is what I am going to talk about. Like I mentioned in my opening paragraph, astrology is a big part of mason belief. The Founding Fathers decided to incorporate the astrological views into our Nations Capital. There are three fixed stars that lie over and align perfectly with the White House, Washington monument, and the Capitol on certain dates. The stars are Arcturus, Regulus, and Spica. It is suggested that fixed stars represent stability and spiritual benevolence, traits that are desirable when constructing a new powerful institutional government. The other thing that makes this pattern all point towards mason teaching is that the constellation Virgo lies in the triangle that the three stars make. Virgo is the astrological sign of Masonry. The sign of Virgo is incorporated everyone in our Nations Capital. From being in buildings to being in the layout of the sky, Virgo has a very strong influence in Washington.</p>
<p>The last aspect I am going to look at in terms of Mason beliefs and Washington D.C. is the architectural design of some of the buildings and monuments. Like I said earlier Mason teachings are associated with Greco-Roman times. If you look at a lot of the buildings and monuments in Washington what do they remind you of? They would remind you of Roman architecture. The Washington monument, in terms of Mason beliefs is a large column. It is one of the largest masonry built things today. Like the roman columns this is one single column standing tall. The one column stands for him being the one, the one that got American started, and the height of it being the like him looking out upon what he started like a father. This is how he was suppose to be remembered. He was the first mason president, he was the father of our country. So the that is what the column represents in mason beliefs. The Jefferson memorial is another one that I am going to look at. Going back to relating these monuments with Roman times the Jefferson memorial looks very similar to the <a title="Pantheon of Rome" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon_of_Rome">Pantheon of Rome</a>. Even though there is no proof that Jefferson was a mason and no proof that he was not, he did heavily support mason teachings and he did have a very strong interest in Roman architecture. So maybe because he liked the Roman architecture so much they constructed his memorial the way they did, but maybe the memorial was suppose to go along with the design of the city and the Mason beliefs that were incorporated already to the city.</p>
<p>It can not just be a coincidence, when Washington was built our founding fathers wanted to make sure that their beliefs would be incorporated into the nation that they were going to form. Even though some of this stuff is just little things and you have to research it to find it, it is still significant towards us knowing what our nation was built upon and the beliefs that is was too. Free Mason teachings is something that not many people fully know about and unless you are a mason you will not know everything that they know. The things we do know are things that support everything that I have said. Free Mason teachings is something our country was built upon, for us to remember what our founding fathers believed and how they wanted our country to be. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/79264857@N00/sets/">Flickr</a> photos</p>

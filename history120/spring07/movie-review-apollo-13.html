			<div class="entry">
				<p>If you were anything more than four or five years old in April of 1970, then you almost certainly remember Apollo 13, America moon mission gone wrong. For everyone else, there the movie Apollo 13, a thoroughly competent if uninspired film that provides a relatively faithful retelling of the gripping story of what happened to the spacecraft some 300,000 kilometers from earth, and how it managed to come home safely. <strong>This is movies really showed us how one mission can untied whole country and people will do whatever take to help each other. Even American didn’t complete the mission.<br />
</strong>there was one scene right before they are going to shoot the mission all the American were watching TV and some of them were watching on live. I think they really care about this is mission; because they want to mission will fly to moon successful. That shows how American loves their country and care about their country.</p>
<p>All movies on back of list and I choice Apollo 13, because I really like space mission, and always want to know more about out space. This movie really gets me into it, because it didn’t showed lots of space knowledge, but it shows how people can work together as team. Though this movie I can tell people back then were all close together. When Tom hanks said we have problem, all people work so hard try getting them out space. Also all American were supporting their heroes and pray for them. That makes people stay together as one.</p>
<p>There are lots of movies about space mission. However, I think apollo13 was the greatest movie about space mission, because people can really see what happened when people were in space. Also movie want to show how people can solve problem in space. Also this movie is telling us, if we can work together as team, we can fix all problems no matter how hard problem we have. </p>
<p>Space is unknown place for most people who live on earth, and people really want to know what is going on outside space. This Movie had lots of picture about spacecraft; they really showed how people live in spacecraft and what kind problems they have to fact it.  Apollo 13 movie bring history live again, I think if people want to know what happening in Apollo 13, when they watch this is movie. They will have better understanding how they went though.</p>
<p>They made this movie to intended young audience and students who really want to know space mission, also this is movie intended people who really like intense and emotional movie.  There is other the most important why people want to watch this movie was they used leading star Tom Hanks, Becon and Paxton. I think Hanks, Bacon and Paxton do a solid job of playing astronauts in this movie. They really show lots of anxiety and intensely in this movie, which brings watcher’s heart up and down. Also the visually was good real, I couldn’t get my eye off TV one second.</p>
<p>The movie itself is really similar to what was really happening. After I watched this movie, I really understand what was really happened to Apollo 13. Because movie director ron howard did really good job in this movie, he really bring to Apollo 13 live again into movie. After I watched Apollo 13 the movie, I know why everyone has been saying the Apollo 13 mission has been called “A Successful Failure”. they didn’t complete this mission land to the moon. However, the astronauts were successfully brought home with everyone helped. The end of movie was so emotionally even they didn’t complete mission, but they got home safety. Everyone was cheering for them not because they complete mission, because they were willing to die for their county.<br />

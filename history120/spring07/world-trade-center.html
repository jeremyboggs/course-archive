				<p>Jaw-dropping, uplifting, intense, a tear-jerker. This movie was spectacular. It is not “old history,” yet, but to our generation it is a real life experience. We all talk about it and can share our stories from that day. I remember it very clearly. I was a freshman in high school and was sitting in religion class when Mr. Hamer came in and whispered something to my teacher. She turned on the television and we all just starred. I was confused, just like the people in the movie were. I thought that the plane had just lost control and it was merely an accident. When the police officers in the movie saw it on their television, they thought the same thing. They said things like maybe the pilot “…ran out of gas” or it was a small plane and the man did not know how to operate his craft. September 11, 2001 was a very chaotic day. <strong>“World Trade Center” was created to show us a personal encounter of what such an evil act can commit, what human beings are capable of and to bring out the goodness of people.</strong><br />
The movie “World Trade Center” is a story based on the lives of two actual survivors, John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno, New York City Port Authority Policemen, and what their families went through. The movie gets to the point right away, within ten minutes the first plane struck the building. However, they did not show the plane actually hit, all that was pictured was the shadow of a plane very close to the ground and a policeman looking up at it. Perhaps this was because the sight of the plane striking the building is too much for certain people who were personally affected by the incident to see it happen. Or it just leads for you to picture it yourself. In a way it is more mysterious not to see it, because one just knows how horrible it really was. There were many graphic images throughout the movie too. For example, when all the citizens were watching the towers burn, you see a lady jump from one of the buildings and fall screaming. It may not be graphic to the point of blood and gore, but emotionally graphic.<br />
The movie was shot through the eyes of the police officers. Everything was so chaotic that even they did not know what was going on. Sergeant McLoughlin was not even aware that a second plane had struck tower two. He was getting his team ready to go up into the first tower when it came crashing down on them. Only three from the fourteen survived the disastrous collapse and eventually one died after having a chunk of the tower crush his lower half, leaving only McLoughlin and Jimeno. The two men were trapped under rubble and smashed from the waist down. There was no way for them to get out from under the heavy slabs of concrete.<br />
Jimeno has a four year old daughter and a pregnant wife, while McLoughlin has four children at home and a wife. What kept these men alive are the thoughts of home and the love they have for their families. The emotion of the families and wives especially was very intense. It had you cheering the men on to live and to not give up. Having the movie focus on the lives of these two men make the event more “heavy.” Instead of just thinking that thousands of lives were lost, you get to see the emotional strain and feelings, concerns, and fears of the men trapped as well as their families. It makes you feel it more and relate to it, could that happen to my husband? The director, Oliver Stone, chose to shoot it this way, instead of just showing a broad view of a general person’s perspective so that you can see how this evil act could tear a family apart. Jimeno’s wife, Allison, asked her father, “How do I tell Bianca her father is dead?”<br />
Anyone can relate to this and think of their father, mother, children, and it pulls at your heart. The intended audience for this film is everyone. This act affected the world. It changed the way people act towards each other, and it changed the way we go about our daily lives. Who doesn’t think a terrifying thought when they first get on the metro? Or see a plane close to the ground? The events that happened on September 11, 2001 will never be forgotten. They taught us a new and better way to live. We need to help one another. In the film, a retired Marine found his sense of patriotism again and left his life behind to go find survivors. He was out there with one other man after all the others had gone home for the night searching for people. He found the two men. If it wasn’t for him they would have died. He knew his calling was to help people and he put them first. He told them, “You are my mission.” John McLoughlin said it best at the end, “Nine Eleven showed us what human beings are capable of…It also brought out the goodness we forgot could exist. People taking care of each other for no other reason that it was the right thing to do…It is important for us to remember.”<br />
Historical facts provided from the movie are seen at the end. Some powerful facts include: 2,749 people died at the World Trade Center, including people from 87 different countries, only twenty people were pulled out alive; Will Jimeno and John McLoughlin were numbers eighteen and nineteen.</p>

			<p>When I read this post, I could somehow relate to the author on the day that it happened. I was at school when someone told my teacher something terrible and he turned on the television to see it for his own eyes. An event that happened so terrible did affect the lives that had lost a loved one from the terrible tragedy.  I like the way that the post author included the quote “It had you cheering the men on to live and to not give up”. The people who helped the victims out of the debris were volunteers who care and wanted to save these people. At such a terrible time, there is nothing more that you can do but to help save these people’s lives. What I didn’t like about this post is this confusing part where it says “Jimeno’s wife, Allison, asked her father, “How do I tell Bianca her father is dead?” The confusing part about this is that it said that he survived. For an terrible even that happened not too long ago, I think this is a great way to show the next generations that this event and these wonderful and caring volunteers made a big difference in today’s society and that no one will ever forget this day.</p>

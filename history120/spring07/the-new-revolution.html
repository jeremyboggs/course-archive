				<p align="center">Amistad</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Amistad is a courtroom drama that was considered a controversy since before it ever came on the movie. There were lawsuits that this movie was taken from an even older script, but the lawsuits were later dropped. Everyone knew it was going to be a big hit and everyone wanted a part of it. Directed by Steven Spielberg, it had a considerable amount of recognized actors, including Matthew McConaughey, Anthony Hopkins, and Morgan Freeman. It’s about a rebellion by Africans in 1839 that were headed toward U.S. for slavery. It starts off with an African who releases himself and his group from chains and takes over a ship and slaughtered the white crew. They are then captured and put to trial in Connecticut. There are major Dilemmas about who claimed them and whether or not to free them. It was a sensitive subject that revolved around many issues including slavery, politics, and the shift of the American society in a very sensitive time between the Declaration of the Independence and the American Civil War in American history.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Slavery had always been an issue in American history, but never at the level when Amistad took place. The north and south had different views and ideas about many topics and slavery was a major issue. Civil War was about to break out at any moment and no solution had been made. So you can imagine how intense this trial must’ve been with everyone engaged and influencing the outcome and fate of the captured Africans. Throughout the movie they explain to us what happened to them, and how they were dragged out of their homes then taken to this ship where they were tortured and treated horribly (Speilburg seems not to hold anything back with the gruesome images), and now had to deal with the American legal system which now considered them slaves. To represent the Africans abolitionist Theodore Joadson (Morgan Freeman) and a lawyer named Roger Baldwin (Mathew McConaughey). They have trouble at first communicating with Cinque (Djimon Hounsou), the African leader who is frustrated at the whole situation, but as the movie goes on Spielberg does a great job at getting the two lawyers and us, the viewers, to sympathize with Cinque who seemed so unusual at the beginning.</p>
<p>The importance of the case caused politic to play a major role in this situation. Because the outcome of the decision will have a key effect on the outbreak of the civil war top politicians had a voice in the courtroom, such as President Martin Van Buren played by Nigel Hawthorne, and Former President John Quincy Adams played by Anthony Hopkins. President Van Buren wanted to please his allies in the southern states, because re-election was near, and also to try and prevent the idea of a civil war breaking out. So in order to do as planned he had to manipulate the courts arrangements. To try and even things out Joadson went to John Quicy Adams and asked if he could speak at the courtroom, because his support would have a great impact. Adams didn’t want to get in the middle of things so at first he decided not to say anything. After thinking over his thoughts and feeling he decided he had to do the right things. He then went to the supreme court and said, “<em>This man is black. We can all see that. But, can we also see as easily, that which is equally true? That he is the only true hero in this room. Now, if he were white, he wouldn&#8217;t be standing before this court fighting for his life. If he were white and his enslavers were British, he wouldn&#8217;t be standing, so heavy the weight of the medals and honors we would bestow upon him. Songs would be written about him. The great authors of our times would fill books about him. His story would be told and retold in our classrooms. Our children, because we would make sure of it, would know his name as well as they know Patrick Henry&#8217;s. Yet, if the South is right, what are we to do with that embarrassing, annoying document, The Declaration of Independence? What of its conceits? &#8220;All men created equal,&#8221; &#8220;inalienable rights,&#8221; &#8220;life, liberty</em>.&#8221; This quote is what changed the outcome of the case.   </p>
<p>Amistad was a movie that was well written and directed. Each actor played the right part and each had significance to the story. It was entertaining and even though the details aren’t known, through research, I found that the ship carrying slave during the same period had the same story as Amistad. It showed us the transition in the idea of slavery in the American society during pre-Civil War era. It showed us the horror of the slave trade and how it impacted our society. </p>

				<p align="center">Movie Review -Schindler’s List</p>
<p>Schindler’s List, directed by Steven Spielberg in 1993 and based on <em>Schindler’s Ark </em>written by Thomas Keneally. <strong>Is based on the true story of Oskar Schindler, a Nazi Czech, who uses cheap Jewish labor to make his fortune in WW2, but is changes his motives and saves over 1000 Polish Jews from execution. </strong>Schindler’s List is based on the Holocaust in the 1940’s where Jewish followers were killed off just because of their faith to Judaism. Not only were Jewish people targeted but the gypsies and disabled as well. On May 9<sup>th</sup>,1945 the Nazis surrendered, killing 9-18 million people.</p>
<p>The purpose of the movie was to educate the younger generation on how brutal the Holocaust was and to still provide a voice to the millions of people who died. It also showed that people did try to help and not everyone was bad, example Oskar Schindler. At first he was greedy and wanted fortune with hiring the Jews, but soon realized how much he could help and turned around and saved over 1000 people. I thought that it was very accurate to history and used it to its advantage. It even was in black and white to give it more of an effect.</p>
<p>I think this movie was intended for the younger generation that did not experience this and it was starting to become more of a history topic than a topic that needed to be remembered. I honestly think that if we didn’t have history to guide us, after 9-11 maybe something like this would of happened to Muslim people living in America? History will always repeat itself but it is up to the people to make sure that the bad doesn’t repeat itself.</p>
<p>The style of this movie was a Historical Drama with a little romance thrown in. I thought it was a good idea for this movie to be in the category drama so the audience could relate to the character more. I thought that having the movie in black and white with some color in certain places like the little girls coat gave it more life ironically.</p>
<p>Schindler’s List was a movie to show the lives of the millions of Jew that were killed because of their religion. I thought that this movie was very close to capturing life and keeping it strong in our hearts.</p>

			<p>The first time that I saw this movie was probably either in elementary or middle school. This movie was very moving and nobody should ever go through such a terrible event like this. Reading this post, I thought that it was very well written and it was more of a critique than a movie review. What I like about this post in particular is the fact that “The purpose of the movie was to educate the younger generation on how brutal the Holocaust was and to still provide a voice to the millions of people who died” I totally agree with the post author because these innocent victims are dead and can’t speak for themselves. The movie is probably one of some ways that can be told to the younger generations of this horrific incident. This movie has brought out the good and the bad of people. There are the bad people who killed the innocent people and there is the good people who try and save the people. I didn’t find anything wrong with this post. I think that the post author had included everything that was required for this movie review.</p>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>Advertising has been a source of media that can be used to see the social trends of different times by seeing what is being portrayed in advertising.<strong>Throughout advertising history, a focus has been given to selling products with a promise of social acceptance, because not being accepted socially is a major individual fear for most people.</strong><br />
One advertisement that uses social acceptance as a selling point is this <a title="Barbasol ad" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/74908776@N00/445142920/">Barbasol ad</a>. This advertisement is selling Barbasol shaving cream, and depicts a bride-to-be talking with her mother about the man she is about to marry. It is implied that the mother is complaining that the man is not rich. The woman&#8217;s reply to this, which is printed is &#8221; but he doesn&#8217;t have to be rich, mother. He&#8217;s got a Barbasol Face!&#8221; This sends out the message to men that being poor will hinder them from finding a wife, unless of course they use Barbasol shaving cream. The advertisement plays on the insecurities men have about not being rich, and shows that with Barbasol that they too can get a beautiful wife as easily as a rich man. It is interesting to note that the image depicted is of the mother altering the wedding dress for the bride. That practice was a lot more common in those days than it is now, and reflects back on the time in which it was made. Also, it is interesting that the advertisement focuses on marraige, because in mainstream culture in those days portraying sex was still taboo. An example of this is in television of that time where couples slept in different beds.</p>
<p>Fast-forwarding to today, another hygiene advertisement is this <a title="Axe ad" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/74908776@N00/445142934/">Axe ad</a>. This advertisement is for Axe body spray, and depicted in the image is a cracked open apartment door with a ticket machine attached that says &#8220;Take a number&#8221; as would be found in a grocery store. This ad is insinuating that this guy who owns the apartment uses axe body spray, and is flocked by so many girls because of this, that he had to put a ticket machine on his door. Further insinuation is that the door is cracked open, because the girls come and go so rapidly that he doesn&#8217;t even have time to close the door. This is selling the social acceptance of the female sex towards the male who wears Axe body spray. It is saying that if a man wears Axe, he will be flocked by women wanting to have sex with him. This shows an interesting contrast with the Barbasol advertisement. In the more prude times the Barbasol ad uses marraige, and in the the more sexually overdosed present, the promise of multiple sexual partners is presented.</p>
<p>A third advertisement that uses social acceptance as a selling point is this advertisement for <a title="Courtley Toiletries ad" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/74908776@N00/445142926/">Courtley Toiletries</a>. The ad shows the Courtley Toiletries set in a very regal setting, characterized by the dark red and gold colors. Also displayed prominently are two gold-outlined horses. Owning horses throughout time has signified wealth and prominence, because they are an expensive endeavor. In addition, the text shown in the largest font on the advertisement states, &#8220;First choice of men who know.&#8221; This makes it seem like there is a high-class backing of this product, and any man who chooses to buy this product will be considered high-class. This advertisement promises the social acceptance of the high class, which many men dream of one day becoming a part of.</p>
<p>The fourth ad that uses social acceptance as a selling point is this <a title="Michelob Beer ad" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/74908776@N00/445142928/">Michelob Beer ad</a>. This ad is selling Michelob Beer with the tagline &#8220;Lose the carbs. Not the taste.&#8221; Also depicted in the background, is a physically fit man doing sit-ups. This ad insinuates that if you choose to drink Michelob Beer, you will become physically fit, while you will gain pounds by drinking other beers. In the society of today, there is an &#8220;obesity epidemic&#8221;, and also thanks to modern popular media, there is a great social importance on being healthy, fit, and not fat. Those of larger structure have a greater tendency to be insecure about their weight, and being accepted into modern society with that weight. This advertisement plays into those insecurities by promising that by drinking their beer one can get fit, and be wholly accepted by society.</p>
<p>Whether being accepted by a future wife, the opposite sex, a group of people, or society as a whole, social acceptance is a grand part of human existence. Throughout many different changes within the different idealogies of different times, the fear of not being accepted is a constant.</p>

			<p>I have to say that I was very interested in reading our blog post. I have to agree with you that advertisments change over time. I really had never thought about it before. You made a very good point in comparing the Barbasol ad to the Axe Body spray ad.  The advertisements we see today for the Axe ads would be completely horrific back in the 1950&#8217;s when the Barbasol ad was out. However, if the Barbasol ad was out today, we would find it very boring and not intriguing at all as we do with the Axe ad. I enjoyed reading it. Good job.</p>

			<p>You did an excellent job of analyzing the advertisements that you posted and showing what each ad was trying to say and how it was implying this. Its true for most people being socially accepted is something huge in their life that they have to have, so they&#8217;ll do whatever it takes to achieve that goal. And you also did a good job of looking at how the ads changed over time, the audience&#8217;s mindset and opinions of different topics has drastically changed. Good job on the post.</p>

			<p>You did a really good job at explaining the advertisements that you had up. You said things that you wouldn&#8217;t think of when you first see the advertisements. I like how you compared the difference in the Ads with the change of time, it shows how much times have changed for just a few decades ago. Also using these different advertisements was a good idea to show the different ways that they appeal to the different people. These advertisements also show how they appeal to people&#8217;s weaknesses. For example the men that wanna get married, fitting into society&#8230;these are things that people worry about a lot during their life. The way you compared made me realize things better and in general it was a very good post.</p>

			<p>I like how you explained the advertisement for Axe body spray.  It is true that today sex is used as a marketing tool in this country far more than it ever was in the past.  I like how you used the Barbasol ad and the Axe ad to show how advertising has changed over the years and gotten more to the point.  I like how also like how you used the Beer ad to show how the company is using social acceptance to sell their product.  Today social acceptance is one of the major driving forces behind our society.  It is what drives people to spend thousands of dollars in some cases just so they can feel like they fit into society better.</p>

			<p>I definitely agree with you that social acceptance is a very important issue to be considered when making an ad. You did a really good job analyzing the ads you picked. You thought about almost every aspect of the ads, even the most minor (but still important) things such as what the cracked door in the Axe ad was implying. The one piece of evidence you gave that really stood out was the how Michelob claims to be low in carbs. I found it interesting because out of all your ads, it is the only one that can somewhat realistically help someone achieve social acceptance. This is because it could actually help someone maintain their weight, while nice toiletries are never going to make someone rich, and neither will a nicely shaved face. </p>
<p>I agree with you that sexuality is more open in more recent times, and I think you did a good job comparing and contrasting how ads change as social norms change over time. I do not know if I would consider having multiple sex partners socially acceptable, but I see what you were getting at. It would have been better if you used two old ads and two new ones. Other than these minor points, you had a strong argument and plenty of evidence to back it up.</p>

			<p>Your post was very well developed and laid out. Your thesis was good, except perhaps a little long. The second part, &#8220;because not being accepted socially is a major individual fear for most people,&#8221; could be taken out for a more smooth flow. I agree that being socially accepted is a big worry on peoples minds and everyone wants to have the hot items or trends of the time. So it is obvious that people will want the products that make people accepted and wanted in the advertisments.<br />
I like your choice of advertisements in how they all relate to one another and you can compare and contrast. Especially the Barbasol Ad and the Axe Ad. Your contrast between the conservative marriage theme and the mutiple sex partners theme is great. And the theory that by using these products one will have a lady. Also, the Toiletries ad definately insinuates high class, and good observation of horses being tied to upper class. The only thing with the beer advertisement is that I dont think they are saying if you drink this beer you will get fit, I believe the theory is if you drink this beer you will not gain a &#8220;beer belly.&#8221; Drinking any type of beer is not going to make you fit.</p>

			<p>Social acceptance is a significant to make an advertisement. As trend and people’s thinking and behavior change over time, the advertisement also change. I agree with you. The advertisements have to be changed to appeal the customers. If the advertisement would not change and not socially accepted, that ad cannot get people’s attention. I really like the way you analyzing the four different advertisement and comparing to show how advertisements have changed over time.  I think you did really good job showing this changes by comparing two contrast advertisements, Barbasol ad and Axe ad. You also did good job in summarizing your idea at the end of your post. I really enjoyed reading it.</p>

			<p>I really enjoyed read your blog, because you did really good job picked up four really good ads and analyzing them. I like how do you compare and contrast. After read you’re analyzing I can really understand why people made those ads, and what were they targeting for. I totally aggress with you people use more sexuality in more recent time, they are really targeting for young people in those days. I think people will buy their product after saw those ads. You also have those picture links in your blog. I think it’s well done and I like very much.</p>

			<p>I think you had a really intersting thesis. I had never really thought of advertising in the sense that people want to be &#8220;socially accepted&#8221;, but I definitely agree with you. Almost every decision people make in their lives are based on what others will think or what the socially accepted norm may be. I think you did a great job using different ad&#8217;s and comparing and contrasting them with one another. Also, I really agree with the part about the Michelob beer. Society is becoming increasingly worried about being fit and healthy; I think you could even do an entire post on this alone.</p>
<p>While I thought it was interesting that you chose to do your ads based on male products, I think it would benefit your thesis more if you used some examples of women wanting to conform to society. This would just really drive home the point that you make in your thesis when you say, &#8220;major individual fear for most people.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Reading this post, I like how you elaborate each picture that you found to support your thesis. The pictures that you found were explained well and easy to understand. All of the pictures that you found were a good example of how advertising reflect ideologies of its time. What I didn’t like about this post is that they didn’t include specifically how advertising in the late 19th centuries reflect concerns and values from those times. Also, they didn’t include what “cultural work” does advertising do.</p>
<p>On some type of level, I do agree on how the post author has answer the question advertising and cultural values in history. What the post author should’ve done is to elaborate more on what the professor is trying to ask from the information sheet. Also, the post author should’ve elaborated their answers more. The similarities that I found between our pictures that they are trying to prove that if you don’t use the certain products then, they are either missing out or something is wrong. I didn’t find that much difference from the authors pictures and mines.</p>

			<p>I really liked the way you set up your post by comparing the older advertisment and then comparing it to a modern advertisment.  It is true that the use of sex does sell products even though they are not the greatest products in the market.  It just becomes more appealing to the eye and the brain like when you see the axe advertisment.  I also like how you put the beer advertisment because apart from sex people are worried about their health and are going crazy about it.  So for them to say the beer that keeps you fit will increase their sales but has anyone actually tried to prove their point and to see if they are right or wrong?  This was a great post</p>

			<p>There was quite a few things I enjoyed about your blog, but the thing I most liked was the comparison between the ads for Barbasol and Axe, and how during time the mentality of marketers have changed. The type of people they target nowadays is totally different than those during the 1950s. Also the way people think has transformed into a more liberal and open society. The beer ad was also interesting because weight awareness has been a major topic and I think that it&#8217;s not because people have gotten fatter but because the media has raised this awareness to obviously get some cash flow and influence people into buying whatever product they were selling.</p>

			<p>I really enjoyed the variety present in your post.  Of all the posts, yours seems to have advertisements which are the most categorically different, yet still tie into your thesis.  Even though your post followed the guidelines of past and present advertising, it was more interesting as an exploration into the facets of &#8220;social acceptance&#8221; and how it is used in advertising.</p>
<p>I wish that the first sentences of each paragraph talked more about how that particular advertisement used &#8220;social acceptance&#8221; to sell the product.</p>

			<p>I found this post interesting. As I was reading the paragraph talking about the Barbasol ad, I thought to myself, hm this seems similar to the Axe adds we see today, but with a modern society spin. I agree that over time advertisements have used the current situation or society in history to sell their products. I found it important that you included in your post the differences in the Barbasol ad and the Axe ad.</p>
<p>The other two ads you chose, the Cologne and the beer ads, I found a little less interesting but still they fit the times in which they were being sold. By watching movies and knowing about plantations and things of that sort, I felt that it was correct to say that the cologne used horses in their ad because horses were associated with wealth in that time period. The beer ad I felt could have been a little better interpreted. I don&#8217;t think that the ad sugggests that the person will become fit by drinking the beer, but that they will not become fat. It was correct to say that there is an obesity problem in the United States, however, like in college students, beer is often times to blame for our growing guts, and all of that late night pizza. Therefore, the &#8216;diet&#8217; fad has been created. Why wouldn&#8217;t beer be created that has no carbs? I think that they are trying to advertise that guy that can have a smokin hot body in the club who downs 7 beers a night, hes still skinny.</p>

			<p>I really enjoyed reading this blog post and I thought it was very interesting, entertaining, and well written.  I&#8217;m 100 percent in agree with you that social acceptance is a very important issue to be considered when making an ad.  Your ideas and examples flowed very well together and that strengthened your paper by a large amount.  The best thing I liked was not only did you compare your examples and ideas but you also contrasted them as well.  I know your suppose to do that anyway, but not everyone does it and its a good way to help make your paper stronger.  I especially liked your example about the axe body spray.  I thought you did an excellent job explaining this example.  Even at the end of the paragraph you pretty much put the whole paragraph into your own words and exaplained it so everybody can understand what was said.  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have any critisism.  I think it was extremely well written and very thought out and planned.  Excellent job!!</p>

			<p>Your explanation of the ads was really good. I was really able to get an understanding of what you were trying to say by reading it. Some of your observations were really good and I had never thought about it that way. Your comparison of the horse to wealth was really cool. It really made sense to me after I read it. I thought that was good. </p>
<p>I enjoyed reading your post and I actually learned a lot from reading it. You made some very good observations and I thought your explantions were good. It is actually really tough for me to make a criticism of your post, but I think you could have narrowed down your thesis a little more.</p>

			<p>Your thesis made a very strong and powerful point.  I agree that people have a need to feel accepted because it gives them a sense of belonging.  It is definitely a fear that of feeling alone or rejected like you have stated.  You bring an important point for everyone living in America today.  It is hard for many of us to be something different from what whatever we may think is normal.  However, I think we tend to stress too much on what is supposed to be &#8220;normal&#8221; that we drift away from really being ourselves.</p>
<p>Your post was great, I enjoyed reading all the evidence you provided to support your thesis statement.  However, you could have made your conclusion longer.  You could have provided more of your thoughts using a couple more sentences.  I thought your conclusion was a bit too brief to summarize all the important and thoughtful points you have previously made.</p>

			<p>I thought that your post and ads were very interesting and I liked how you had a theme that connected all the ads. You did a really good job explaining all the ads and what the meaning was behind them. At first you wouldn’t see all the points that you made. I liked how you made the point that the ads were connected by social acceptance and not something like sex appeal. Overall I thought your post was well written and I couldn’t find anything wrong with it.</p>

			<p>You supported your ideas very well in the post. I thought that your thesis was very clear, which helped the overall theme of the post. Your insight into the ads was pinpoint. Ads are very specific on the insecurity or fear that they play on, and you noticed that very well. I think your post was good. The one small area you could work on is your wordiness. Besides that, I think the post was good.</p>

			<p>Your post was well written and made good points. Your examples were also unique. The idea that everybody looks to be accepted or fit into society is important to people. We find that everybody wants to fit in. Ads on tv or in magazines cause people to group together and feel as if they have been accepted into a way of thinking. Well written post I enjoyed reading it. You used good exapmles and good supporting arguments. Well done.</p>

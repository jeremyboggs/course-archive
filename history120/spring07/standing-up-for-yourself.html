				<p>During the 1950’s and 60’s, it was a time where the African-Americans made a mark in history for doing what they believe in which is telling everyone that they are the same as every human being out there. Their encouragement will teach the future that they should be equally treated like the rest of the human population. African-Americans were segregated in almost every aspect including public transportation, public restrooms, and public water fountains. Bus and train transportation did not provide separated vehicles for each race but they did divide the sections of the bus and train according to your race. <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_parks">Rosa</a></strong><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_parks"> Parks</a> refused to give up her seat to a white man and till this day; no one will be where they are right now if it wasn’t for Rosa Parks.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong> <strong>            </strong>Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white man sparked a lot controversy. So severe and outrageous, she was arrested and her case was taken to the court where she was found guilty. With the African-Americans on her side, they boycotted and rallied in the rain which took 382 days. While this was going on, African-American homes and churches were burn. So outrageous, the boycott gained a lot of support around the community and the case of Browder vs. Gayle was file which ended segregation on public buses.         </p>
<p>            What Rosa Parks did was very courageous. Being an African-American during that time was very difficult. Everything that you did was not allowed. It seemed as if someone was watching you trying to catch every move that you did. Rosa Parks believed in herself and didn’t want to be treated differently. Rosa Parks have made a difference in today’s society which allows anyone to do whatever they want to do. With so much freedom, we wouldn’t be doing what we want if it wasn’t for Rosa Parks. Rosa Parks is a wonderful influence on everyone out there that cannot believe in themselves. What Rosa Parks did has earned her recognition around the country. Being brave as it is, it teaches us to stand up for yourself and don’t let the law stop you from doing something that you believe is right.</p>

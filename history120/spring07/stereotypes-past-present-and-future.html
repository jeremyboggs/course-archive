			<div class="entry">
				<p>A stereotype is a conception or opinion of people made from observations concerning people from a “group”.  Stereotypes can be a positive reflection on a group of people or it can be a nasty reflection. For example, all blondes are stupid, or more seriously, all Jewish people are cheap (negative) or all Asians are smart (positive). Stereotypes are wrong either way since you are saying that every single member of that group is something without knowing any facts. Stereotypes are based on previous experience and then continued on in future experiences with someone different but from that same group. Stereotypes have been around for centuries. Americans did not want the Irish in their country, so instead of understanding them and giving them a chance, they judged them first and formed stereotypes against them. Americans also have seen woman for years as inferior to men, weak, and that they should be only objects that are seen and/or mothers. These and more stereotypes continue on today. New stereotypes of today include, all middle easterners are terrorists and Americans are fat. <strong>Nineteenth Century stereotypes do the same work as stereotypes today; both categorize and both wrongly judge people.</strong> It is not good that stereotypes are still carried on and that new ones are constructed everyday.</p>
<p>In the 1850’s the Irish started trickling over to America to escape poverty and famine, but they were directly unwanted. This can be explained in that Americans were afraid of change and afraid that these illiterate, poor, unskilled people would deteriorate their beloved country that they had recently created. Americans decided to view the Irish as mean, feisty, unruly, and “incapable of becoming American”. They were not given a chance to mingle in society, thus the Irish could not even try to become Americanized. The Irish were viewed the same way the North <a title="Resource" href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/exploring/19thcentury/alienmenace/">viewed</a> the blacks. This stereotype is still accepted today, but a few things have changed. The Irish are still viewed as feisty and rough, but in a more positive way. The “fighting Irish” is a term used to describe them. This <a title="Fighting Irish" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17302319@N00/434589805/in/pool-history120-spring07/">cartoon</a> of the fighting Irish is associated of course with sports. But it depicts the fighting Irish in a good way. Meaning they are tough and will win against the other team. These days being tough and mean are ways of staying alive and surviving. The Irish must have stuck it out and survived since they are welcomed and loved these days. This stereotype changed over time, but not all do.</p>
<p>Women have always been seen as weak, pretty, or just a typical homemaker and mother. Basically one that has no influence on society and an object that should be concerned with appearance. Also, women are seen as those that gossip and talk about things that have no significance. This <a title="19th Century Woman" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17302319@N00/434619175/in/pool-history120-spring07/">picture</a> is from the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Women at that time were seen as inferior to men. They should not work, vote, or have any power. The men were the ones that had all control. Women those days thought their place was at home and taking care of the family because that’s what society was telling them by stereotyping them into this group. Today woman are encouraged to have careers but <a title="Women" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17302319@N00/434619149/in/pool-history120-spring07/">magazines</a> mass advertise ways to look good in the work place. Both photos encourage an attractive appearance and both talk about petty insignificant “gossip”. The magazine clip give secret hints on where to find the best bargains or ways to look pretty in a short time. There is no encouragement to make an impact or columns informing them of important world topics. There are no “hints” on how to work your way to another level in society. Women are still being compressed into the circle of appearance and inferiority.</p>
<p>Stereotypes will forever be present. They may change over time but essentially they still do the same thing, categorize and wrongfully judge. Not all women are concerned with beauty and bargains. Some women work hard and are concerned with politics and ways to improve the world, but it is hard to find help when they are still being seen as pretty objects. I am sure not all Irish men drink and fight regularly. Continuing stereotypes just paves the way for new ones. A new stereotype today is that Americans are fat and infatuated with food, like in this <a title="American Stereotype" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17302319@N00/434589801/in/pool-history120-spring07/">photo</a>. The clip shows a very jolly man, obviously an American, extremely happy to have so much unhealthy food. He does not seem to have another care in the world, he has what he wants. I chose to add this photo because it shows that new stereotypes are created frequently based on the fact that a large number of Americans are overweight. However this leads to an outsider viewing all Americans as overweight. Stereotypes do nothing to fix a problem. Instead they poke fun at the subject and force people to continue to view things the way they are. Stereotypes contribute nothing to society.          </p>

			<p>You raise some good points, particularly with your &#8220;new stereotypes are created everyday.&#8221; i liked that you backed that up with a stereotype against Americans opposed to another one Americans have created. One quote I saw that seemed a little off to me was, &#8220;The Irish were viewed the same way the North viewed the blacks&#8221; I think you may have over simplified things with this. It was more that the Irish were viewed in the North as Blacks were veiwed in the South.</p>

			<p>I agree that stereotypes are wrong because it is highly unlikely that every single member of a specific cultural group is the same in a particular area.  Stereotypes do however contribute something to society, they may not contribute anything good to society but they definitely contribute something.</p>

			<p>I liked how you included women your post as a group our society tends to stereotype.  It&#8217;s great you&#8217;re acknowledging that there is still this masculine and feminine figure people have to be categorized in.  I just wish some day we can see people as an individual rather than judging them by their ethnicity, race, color, sex, etc.  We find negative things to say about a certain group of people, that we do not allow people to prove who they are as an individual.</p>
<p>I like how you are addressing this controversial topic about stereotypes.  However, your post could be improved if you discuss in your conclusion ways to change the ways we tend to perceive a group of people to be.  What are some things we can do to be active in this subject to prevent this separation?  Overall I enjoyed reading your post.</p>

			<p>It is unfortunate that stereotypes will never change. Another one about women that your first picture reminded me of is that women like to spend men’s money on clothes and useless things. This is an annoying stereotype since so many women these days work hard for the money they have. One stereotype that is dying out though is that men always pay for dates. Most ladies do like to pay for the date sometimes.<br />
	 You did a very good at addressing the different stereotypes you brought up. I think you should have gone into further detail on some of the ones that you mentioned, such as the Muslim and Jewish people stereotypes.</p>

			<p>I liked this post a lot and I thought you touched on a lot of things and different stereotypes from other posts. I liked how you had a lot of information to go along with the ads that you decided to use. You described them and then commented on them very nicely. I liked how you commented on the stereotypes of Americans because its proof that everybody of all races are stereotyped. Maybe not in the same ways as others but everyone gets stereotyped, positive or negative. </p>
<p>I think the you should of had a better conclusion on what you were talking about and went back and explained and recapped everything you were trying to say. You just had your paragraph on your last ad and didn&#8217;t finish your post so to me it just seemed incomplete. In your conclusion you could of went into more detail about what you touched on in the opening paragraph. Just an idea. Good post overall though.</p>

			<p>I think you organized this really well. I especially like your concluding paragraph where you talk about today&#8217;s stereotypes and how they don&#8217;t contribute at all to society. While I understand why some stereotypes begin, in today&#8217;s society we should be above the negative grouping of people.</p>

			<p>The Points that you bring up are great and you really hit this issue on the nose. The fact that you said you brought women into this issue was very interesting, yet in a positive way. Most of the time when we speek of stereotypes, women are left out. We usually only speek of races not gender; but there are alot of stereotypes for women out there that are even more prevelant than sterotypes for races. </p>
<p>Your voting link that sent me to that showed the picture of the man and asked if what we thought he was. I thought that was great! it shows truley how we view stereotypes, great job on your post.</p>

			<p>I agree with your thesis, stereotypes have and will always do the same thing. You had some very interesting points on how there are new stereotypes happening everyday because of events that are happening around us everyday, and the american obesity was a great example. I do not however agree about the women stereotype, maybe thats how it was back in the day but I do not agree with that because there are many women that have/are doing great things with their life, equal or better to men. And the example you used about how in magazines they show the best bargains for women, they do the same for men so it doesn&#8217;t exactly prove your point.</p>

			<p>I do agree with your post that stereotypes can be both negative and positive and they can change over time but not all of them as you did mention in your post.  Sometimes it can change for the better or sometimes for the worse.  In the section about women i do agree that back in the day they did not have a voice but these days they do have a voice in socity and the biggest women voice is oprah winfrey and she is also a powerful women.  But great job with the post.</p>

			<p>It was a good point you made when you stated that a stereotype can be negative or positive, because it is true. Giving a generalized characteristic for a group of people is wrong and will always maintain a problem in the world. The comparisnon of the Irish of the north and the blacks of the south was interesting. I thought you should&#8217;ve brought more solid information about what you were trying to prove, but overall well written post.</p>

			<p>This blog post had a very strong thesis statement, very opinionated, but you upheld your opinion throughout the rest of the blog.I liked how you said that stereotypes can be both negative and postive, however, either effect they have, a generalization about a group will never suffice to represent every individual in the group. The generalization that all Asians are smart, although a positive stereotype, it is entirely untrue. One element I felt was weak of your post was that you say stereotypes will never go away, although this is probably true, stereotypes have been reduced and made less negative with time, and as American continues to blend, I felt you should have added this point. Overall I felt that the most interesting part of this blog was when you said &#8220;continuing stereotypes pave way to new ones.&#8221; This ties your blog to the beginning when you made your thesis statement. It shows your feelings about stereotypes and how they are essentially a wrong factor in our society that has exsisted in the past, continues to exisit in the present and will probably go on in the future.</p>

			<p>I like how you bring up modern stereotypes.  It&#8217;s easy to forget that, as you say &#8220;new ones are constructed every day.&#8221;  I really got a kick out of the national stereotype of Americans as foodoholics.  It makes me wonder though: What stereotypes is the rest of the world making about us?</p>
<p>You did a good job of investigating the causes of stereotyping.  Fear does seem to play a big role in stereotypes past and present.  Back then, there was a fear of the Chinaman taking jobs. Today, it&#8217;s Hispanic immigrants.  During WWII there was a fear of anyone who looked Japanese, simply because of Pearl Harbor and Japan&#8217;s involvement in the war. Today we can be said to fear the stereotypical &#8220;Middle-Eastern Terrorist.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think that saying stereotypes are wrong because they make broad judgments of a large group of people is incorrect.  There are REAL differences between people groups, and they are due to cultural differences.  &#8220;Black culture&#8221; and &#8220;White culture&#8221; are different, and to deny that is just as wrong as making assumptions about people based on stereotypes.  Take stereotypes with a grain of salt, certainly, but meet everyone with an open mind and accept that they will be different from you.</p>

			<p>Overall, I agreed with your post. Stereotypes will always remain a part of this world. I loved how you did not just use race as a steroetype. I feel that you were a little scatterbrained though. You could have brought some more solid arguements. You sort of restated what we said in calss we discussing segregation. However, you did have storng points and like I said it was an overall good post.</p>

			<p>I agree that stereotypes do ntohing to our society and I liked how in your ending paragraph you stated the issue of how new stereoypes are occurring everyday.  The best thing I like about your post is you examples and how you brought women into the topic as well.  I totally agree with you that women are a huge stereotypical topic in the world today.  Though they are getting much more respect as before, the past is still there and even though women had barely ny right&#8217;s back then, they are still getting stereotyped for it now.  Its just not fair and I&#8217;m a guy.<br />
I don&#8217;t really see where your conclusion is in the post.  I see the last paragraph and it only talks about women and another stereotype about fat.  There is really nostrong conclusing paragraph in which you review what you have said.  Neext time just put a conclusion.  All in all good job.</p>

			<p>I agree with what you said about stereotypes being wrong because obviously it’s wrong to assume that all people of a certain group will act or behave in a certain way just because some do that. But I really think that stereotypes in general will not change, it just seems to be something that is impossible because there will always be ignorant people out there that assume all people of a certain group are the same.  The organization of your post was done quite well. And it’s true that stereotypes don’t contribute to society in any way. One thing you could have included to back your argument better was some hard facts.</p>

			<p>I really enjoyed read your blog, because you make very good point stereotype can be both positive and negative. People figure out other people by what they wear, speak and do, and also people see other as a group rather than individual. They only judge them by sex, color, race and ethnicity. I think most the part was ethnicity, because they American is a immigration country people come from different place. Also people have negative things and thought about people who from other place, and Stereotype will never change. I really like how you explain different stereotypes and gave us very good examples. Also you add some other links for us read, so we can understand your blog easier. I think this is well done post.</p>

			<p>I really enjoyed reading your blog, it makes good sense. You explain the sterotypes people have and what they lead to. I beleive that with a certain amount of eduacation people can over come the generaizations. Overall your blogs was very good and informative. Good Job</p>

			<p>Your post was very interesting. Your style of writing makes your arguments very believable. I think that you did a good job with your examples of sterotypes and the reasoning of why they are wrong. The one area i thought could have been changed is how sterotypes are wrongly judge people. Sterotypes do classify people into certain groups, but  i think it could be seen in more shades of grey, than just right and wrong. Besides that i enjoyed your post.</p>

			<p>I really enjoyed reading your post. I thought it was very interesting and it stated your point very clear.  I liked how you incorporated the woman stereotype into your post. I think sometimes people forget that gender can also be a stereotype and its not always about what culture you belong to. I also liked how you added that not all stereotypes are bad. There are some positive stereotypes and some negative.  Overall I think you did a great job on this post.</p>

				<p>In my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/14675687@N00/399097413/">community</a> , the resident ranges from newborns to the elderly. Anyone is welcome as long as they can accept the rules. Who isn’t allowed in our community are trouble makers and anyone who cannot accept our rules. Our community as a whole is very trusting and caring. Since the population is only 3,000, everyone knows how everyone is and during special events, we all get together to play games and socialize. The layout of my community is very simple and spacious. The brick houses where the residents live are usually grouped together so no one is living by their self alone unless you are the mayor (which is elected by the people of my community) of the community which needs to be separated from everyone else so they can oversee and protect the whole community. Near the homes of the residents are farmlands so they can plant their own vegetables and fruits so they can eat and sell it to the market. Near the farmland are the orchards for clean air and fresh fruits and nuts.  The public building and the park is walking distance so you don’t have to drive to get there even there are roads to get there. On the other side of the river are the woods and the factory mill. You can tell that no one lives there. What is great about this community is that everyone is very hard working therefore, no one is homeless. Everyone is well to do. <strong>There will always be problems within a community such as drinking, sexual behaviors, and complex marriages therefore, we will have to work together to prevent this from happening.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>In order to have a safe and trusting community, we must work together. From my point of view, the residents in my community are always working together when there’s a serious problem going on. Problems such as drinking, sexual behaviors, and complex marriages which are mention on this <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/exploring/19thcentury/simutopia/index.php">link</a>. These problems that are happening in my community is very devastating because not is it only hurting us individually, but it is hurting us as a whole community.</p>
<p>The goal for my community is to solve our most serious problems which are drinking, sexual behaviors, and complex marriages. The reason for solving these serious issues is so that future generations won’t be exposed to these serious issues. These serious issues are damaging and will tear this wonderful community apart. Without the exposure to these serious issues, everyone in the community will be safer and there will not be a lot of kids in the orphanages. In conclusion, these problems and issues need to be solved because it will tear up this community</p>

			<p>Because of my pessimistic nature, it seems I can only find the bad in everything. Especially with no comments for me to see at the moment.  like that you want your community to work towards the elimination of the very concept of drinking, sex (I&#8217;m going to assume of the recreational kind) and complex marrage. I am confused as to how you would be able to achieve that specifically. If everyone works together, they can work until nothing is done since they don&#8217;t know what they are doing. Not that I have any suggestions to remedy this. Perhaps strict law enforcement? I don&#8217;t know.</p>

			<p>Oops, I looked at the post requirements, and I see that you don&#8217;t need a how. So I have to have to find something else wrong. I don&#8217;t think the mayor of the town should be separated from everyone else. He would get detacted from the needs of the citizens.</p>

			<p>Drinking and sex seem to be the least of the problems that societies face today.  Murder and cooruption are far higher on the list of problems that we face as a society.  Keeping the community small is a good idea because if people know each other problems are less likely to arise.</p>

			<p>This is very interesting post, because you build your very own simutopia. Also you have set up rule for those people who are living in your town, and showed us when people live in this town they will be happy. In this blog I found out something I agree with you, you said there will always be problem within a community. Though the history almost every town and place had their own problems such as drinking, sexual behaviors and gang. If we want to have safe place for living, I think we must work together and built safe place for us to live. after read your blog, I want to have my own simutopia that I want to built. I really enjoy read your post.</p>

			<p>I liked some of the ideas that you had for your utopia. I thought it was a good idea to address drinking, sexual behaviors, and complex marriages because those are things that  you should try and control some what. You are looking out for your community as a whole and trying to prevent what you think are the biggest decisions that society faces as a whole and that is good, because it will allow people to be happier because it is something less for them to worry about. </p>
<p>My problem with this society is that I don&#8217;t like the idea of discriminating against certain people. Its not fair. I know the crime rate would go down and all of that stuff. Is it really fair to discriminate someone that can&#8217;t follow the rules? I don&#8217;t think so. As people we should be forgiving and give people second chances that can&#8217;t follow the rules to get their life back on track. It would be strange to think about living in a perfect society where no one broke any rules. Its how we learn things by making mistakes and learning from them. Thats my problem with your Utopia is that everyone is treated equally.</p>

			<p>Your approach to the simutopia was different than mine. I took mine as a way to keep factory life and farm life separate. This would also be a way to keep work and private life separate as well. Your way of doing it, is very interesting. You have it set up so that everybody works together and you focus on growing the town as a whole and making it prosper. I never really thought about doing it this way. It is actually a unique approach to doing it! </p>
<p>I really like how you elaborated on why you did what you did. Most of your reasons for placing certain things where you did make sense. I like how you really explained and elaborated on the aspects of your simutopia. If I had to make a suggestion, I would tell you that maybe these aren’t as important issues as the others. I mean, I think that the Jacksonian Americans may have been facing far more difficult problems, but this is your approach and your simutopia! Very cool!!!</p>

			<p>This utopia sounds like a nice place to live, but I do not think the paper goes far enough in describing and attempting to solve these complex problems.  All you say is that we have to work together to solve these complex problems, I think it would have been a lot better if you had given us a few suggestions on where to start.  Your map is filled in pretty good, but I’m not sure a factory burning garbage should be so close to the rest of the town, because that stuff will stink for miles.</p>

			<p>I thought it was a well organized paper, but you should&#8217;ve put more focus on other problems that we face. I thought that drinking, sexual behaviors, and complex marriages aren&#8217;t the main problem a society faces. Subjects such as murder and theft would&#8217;ve been more effective to talk about.</p>

			<p>I liked how in the beginning you stated that anybody is allowed in your utopia if they don&#8217;t break the rules.  This is a good idea and will attract a lot of people&#8217;s attentions.  On the other hand, it can get out of hand because how will you know whose good or bad at first?  They might seem good, but then they might turn out to become bad.  So you might just want to watch out for that.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t agree with the idea that drinking and sex need to be dealt with immediatly to have a good community.  What about the jobs, the money, or the land?  All you have to do is make very strict rules so that they won&#8217;t do it anymore.  This may not prevent everything, but if it continues than just throw them out.  Honestly, alcohol and sex is not gunna be your problem.  There are other bigger and more important things to worry about.</p>

			<p>I agree with the first second note. In order for an authority figure to successfully monitor his community is to be a part of it. By secluding him or her, you don&#8217;t allow them to see exactly what needs to be done. They can only see the big issues, not the little things. Problems such as sex and marital issues aren&#8217;t as bad as this makes them seem, it gives people stuff to gossip about and it happens all the time. Problems such as theft in such a small community I feel could be resolved fairly easily if plans were implemented. I also feel that that isn&#8217;t the biggest issue that needs to be discussed.</p>

			<p>I like the idea of how your community is, but its completely unrealistic. No matter how small, or how nice a town is drinking, sex, and marriage will always be a problem. I also dont agree with the towns people being involved with martial problems. I&#8217;m sure the last thing any fighting couple would want is the entire town getting involved.Other than that it seemed like a nice little town that would be interesting to grow up in.</p>

			<p>It is great that you do not discriminate anyone from your community.  The way you describe your utopia seems inviting and hospitable.  For example, you mentioned that negative results of drinking and sexual behaviors are prohibited.  I like that no one is homeless so that everyone can get their fair share of wealth.  I agree that you do need someone that will overlook the community in order to settle disputes and show some sort of ruling.  This will prevent people from thinking that they are free to act in an unreasonable manner since they are restricted to certain things.</p>
<p>I did not like how you centered your blog on what you prohibit.  There should have been more description on the religion, education, social hierarchy, etc.  I was still left confused reading your blog because you missed a lot of the core points.  You could have also explained more of why you put places at a certain place.  Overall, I think you could have expanded more to better my understanding of your community.</p>

			<p>I think the way you went about making your utopia was creative, like how you seperated everything very distinctly from one another. In my utopia, I pretty much just spread everything out and made different neighborhoods, so I think it is interesting to think of how a community would be different if everyone lived literally in the same area as opposed to neighboring residences. I also thought how you brought up the fact that your town was a small town was a good idea. Historically, small towns have less crime and illegal activity, so I can see why your main issues in your town would be things like sexual activity, complex marriages, and drinking.</p>
<p>I do think you should talk more about the people in your town. Do they have certain religious beliefs or a certain value system? Also, obviously people do not want &#8220;bad&#8221; people in the town, but I&#8217;m not sure I understand what you mean by they would not be allowed in your town. Would that just apply to criminals trying to move into the town? What if someone in your town broke a law, would they be kicked out? I think you could go into a little more detail about these things, but overall I got a good sense of what your community was like and the problems it faces.</p>

			<p>I like that your community is well organized, the placement of your buildings, farms and what not all makes sense, its logical. However, it does concern me that your biggest &#8220;issues&#8221; are sex, alcohol and complex marriages. It seems like youre trying to make a pleasantville-esqu community, does your population not have sex at all? Is this to prevent your population from expanding beyond 3000? I personally would not want to live in a world lacking in exposure to all ranges of emotions, I feel like in order for people to be people they should not be restrained in their enviornment. Yes, there are measures that should be taken to ensure the safety and well being of those who live in a community, but when do safety measures turn into a mold shaping everyone into a similar drone? Do you think the people of your community could truly be happy over a long period of time?</p>

			<p>It would be wonderful if everyone in a community followed all rules, and dedicated their lives toward the greater good of the community. This would be typical of a true utopia, but as you stated, “There will always be problems within a community”. These problems, such as drinking, sexual behaviors, and complex marriages are natural human tendencies that cannot be completely wiped out of the picture. Future generations will always be exposed to these issues no matter what. Also, I noticed that the entire community shares one big farm area. I don’t think that people will buy anything at the market if they can just go pick it out of the farm. Another problem with your community is that everyone is a farmer. Where are your citizens getting their clothing, the bricks for their houses, and whatever they are “driving” when you don’t have any factories? I don’t think that this community would ever realistically flourish.</p>

			<p>I think that it is great that your community is trying to do away with the evils of drinking, promiscuous behaviour and other social problems because these are some problems that really affect society negatively. I also agree with some of the other posts that you should also consider other issues such as crimnal activities.</p>

			<p>What type of sexual behaviors are you talking about? Premarital, homosexual, cheating spouses.. If you are talking about sexual behavior as a whole, then how are you planning on continuing your town for further generations? Since that is a natural part of life, I really do not see how it&#8217;s a serious issue or how it would tear your community apart. If anything, it would add to and further develop your community- haha. And you should probably define complex marriage too. Everyone has problems and at some point or another, a marriage is going to get complex. Just like sex, it&#8217;s bound to happen; I don&#8217;t see your reasoning behind trying to prevent these things.</p>

			<p>Your post was good in that you explained the layout of the town. Farmland to make your own way, orchards to relax in, it is all very nice. I wonder if it is best to have the mayor living outside the community. It might be better to have him living within the community so that he can experience the evils that go on there and work to fix them. However, you did not go into detail on how the problems of alcohol, sex, complex marriage etc. would be fixed and that was the thesis. Examples of how the people could or should work together to overcome these evils should be discussed. They will not go away just having the town layed out a certain way.</p>

			<p>Everything seems to be thought out very well. Everybody working together to help everyone else out is a great idea.  Having the houses built in the same general area is also a very good idea.  It will be difficult to have everyone working to help other people out since it&#8217;s survival of the fittest for the most part.  But your society seems to be a very happy place where everyone knows veryone&#8217;s name and they celebrate together as a community.  The only thing is that you don&#8217;t show where the mayor would live in your map.  You mention that he/she will not be near the rest of the community, which could lead to the creation of class levels.  You don&#8217;t go into very much detail when it comes to governing things, just that the mayor is elected by the people.  Also, I don&#8217;t like the way your thesis was written, it has a good idea, but the way that it was written doesn&#8217;t seem to flow.</p>

			<p>I would love to live in your utopia. Your community sounds very welcoming. Wouldn’t it be great to live in a community where everyone actually followed the rules? But in reality is that even possible? Looking at your community, I see you only have farmers living in your community, how will the people get anything if everyone is a farmer.<br />
Another thing I don’t understand is what you mean by sexual behavior. You failed to explain that further. Do you mean no sex at all? If that is what you mean, your community would die off. Don’t you want future generations to keep you community flourishing?  I think that in society today we are facing much greater problems than drinking, sexual behavior, and complex marriages.<br />
Overall your post was interesting and like I said before I would love to live in your utopia it seems like peaceful place. I just don’t think your community will prosper.</p>

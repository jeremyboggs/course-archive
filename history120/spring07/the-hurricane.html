			<div class="entry">
				<p>            <strong>The Hurricane tells a deeply moving story of injustice, racism and struggle.</strong> Something all too familiar to many African Americans in the 60’s and 70’s.  Rubin’s ability to mentally overcome his boundaries are truly inspiring and show that anything can be overcome if we put ourselves over those who do us wrong. I say “put ourselves over” because that is exactly what Rubin Carter did, he took his mind and elevated it to a level of understanding and perception, a level of wisdom, that is seldom seen in any individual. He put his mind far out of the reach for any man who wishes to take the one thing he had not lost – his pride.</p>
<p>            When we think of racism, discrimination and corruption in the 60’s and 70’s we often think of the more Southern region of the United States. But for Rubin Carter, a man from New Jersey, racism played an essential role in his life; much of which was spent in and out of prison. The story is told in a dramatic fashion, full of emotion and heart wrenching moments. It comes across as movingly artistic, as if the whole film were an epic story of one man’s struggle. Norman Jewison, the film’s director, made a movie not just built on the basis of entertainment but on awareness, education and maybe most importantly truth. For many people who choose to turn their cheek on the racist aspects of America this film serves as a rude awakening. The depiction of human suffering is something that leaves an impression on people, it opens their eyes to reality, to what really goes on and to what really does happen. Racism and discrimination are not just things we see in textbooks and movies, it is reality and it is often overlooked. </p>
<p>            Most of the movie takes place in the late 60’s through the late 80’s, a period fresh off the wake of the civil rights movement. Rubin’s struggle is just one story of both men and women ripped from their lives because of the color of their skin. His fight for freedom is one consistent with history, injustice after injustice after injustice. In the end, as with many cases similar to Rubin’s, the end is simply another display of fallacies in the American judicial system not yet fixed. The film does a good job of putting deception in the direct spotlight and really putting the facts surrounding the case out to the public’s eye.</p>
<p>            To think of a movie critically it is important to weigh the movies historical accuracy, obviously leaving slack for the purpose of entertainment. Attempting to use a movie for a historical source is a risky business, as things are often left out or exaggerated. In this case, I could not find any incorrect historical events or embellished stories but I still ask myself if its really accurate. This particular event deals with one man and the people who chose to “save” his life, the outcome had no great effect on the American judicial system, it did not change any laws or impact people’s physical lives. It did however impact people’s hearts, everyone from inmates to celebrities. Rather than seeing the movie or the event as a significant historical source I would use Rubin and his life as a source for something in relation to psychology or philosophy. His wisdom and view on life were truly insightful, far beyond the understanding of most individuals and I plan on looking further into his writings and his ideas, Rubin “Hurricane” Carter is without a doubt an inspirational figure.</p>

				<p>When I was a little kid, I used to love taking the Metro train with my family to Washington, D.C. to visit the monuments and museums.  We would spend all day just looking at the monuments and memorials that were scattered throughout the National Mall.  I remember thinking that the “Pencil” had the eraser underground.  I later realized that it was just the Washington Monument.  My favorite memorial was the Vietnam Wall since it was completely different from every other monument that I saw.  I never really thought about why the designer made it that way or what it means when the Wall goes from smallest to largest then back down to smallest.  But now that I think about it, everything has a meaning in the National Mall.  There were three monuments that came to mind when we were first assigned this project, the Lincoln Memorial, Vietnam War Memorial, and the Korean War Memorial.  I decided to analyze how the people dedicated in each memorial were depicted to the public.  <strong>The way the monuments present people is how the public saw them by using color, size, and material that mean certain ideas.<br />
</strong>As I stepped from the escalator and walked towards the map to see where each monument was, I noticed how long the walk was to get to the Lincoln Memorial.  So I walked towards it and once I got to the new World War II Memorial and centered myself on the Reflecting Pond, I could see the entire Lincoln Memorial.  I still had a ways to go until I got to the first steps.  I noticed, as I walked up the steps, that the color and size of the steps changed as I got closer to the statue of Lincoln.  You will notice in this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488492660/">picture</a> that the color goes from a dirty brown color to a much cleaner pearl color.  The steps also become narrower, requiring taking more steps to move an equal distance.  This could mean that the immediate area around the statue of Lincoln is sacred, so the material has to be a cleaner white and only those who can make it up the smaller steps can see Lincoln.  If you complete the task of climbing up the stairs, you will see this huge God-like statue of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488492628/">Lincoln</a>.  Above Lincoln there is an engraving that uses the word “temple” to describe the memorial.  In this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488492642/">picture</a>, notice how Lincoln seems to be looking out towards Washington, D.C.  This is almost as if he is protecting the city from any harm, just like he did for the Union and the slaves during the Civil War.  To the left and right of the monument, there are these huge engravings of the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488492634/">Gettysburg Address</a> and the Emancipation Proclamation, respectively.  As you can see by the Gettysburg Address, it basically takes up the entire wall.  This is to show that these documents are just as important as Abraham Lincoln was.  It is no wonder that Lincoln is considered to be our greatest president.</p>
<p>From the Lincoln Memorial, I walked over to the Vietnam War Memorial.  But before I could even get to the Wall, there was a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488492634/">statue</a> of a group of men that are just standing there.  These men are just about life-size and are made of a different material than the one used to make Lincoln.  It appears to be a bronze color, almost the same color as dirt or mud which is unclean.  Also notice that this statue has an African-American in it.  This was added most likely since the war was happening during the Civil Right movement.  There is also another <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488492720/">statue</a> very similar to this one, but it is on the other side of the walkway and it is there to honor the women who helped in the war.  As for the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488656805/">wall</a> itself, this picture shows just one panel that contains the thousands of names that lost their lives in the war.  The material is a dark, reflective marble that is like a mirror.  This war is the first one that the United States lost and it was a very dark time in our history with the war, assassinations, and the protests.  This <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488492668/">picture</a> was taken at the end of the Vietnam Wall.  You will notice that it starts out very low, coming up to the waists of the two women standing there.  As you walk towards the center, the wall grows to this huge structure that is twice as tall as anyone else observing it.  You will also notice that there is a space where spectators can pay their respects by placing flowers, cards, or photographs of their loved ones.  The different size of the wall can signify the problem of the war, or the number of troops sent overseas.  At first, it was only a small scale, but when LBJ received a blank check, the war reached its climax then slowly died down when it was realized that we were going to lose the war.</p>
<p>The Korean War Memorial is on the other side of the Lincoln Memorial.  I did not know that this memorial even existing until last year.  I guess it is because there aren’t many movies made about this movie.  But this is the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488604637/">first full view</a> you see when you walk towards it, a squad patrolling in what is mostly likely rain since they are wearing ponchos.  These life size statues are the major component to the Korean War Memorial.  As you can see, these statues are very close to the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488604659/">wall</a> that is similar to that of the Vietnam War Memorial.  The main difference in the two walls is that there are no names, but just faces of those who have lost their lives.  All of the military branches are represented in this wall.  Since the memorial has faces and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488604673/">life size statues</a>, the public probably thought the war was a better success than the Vietnam War, even though it was a draw.  The statues are a grayish color, which is neutral, which is another way of showing that there was no clear winner in the war.  This is a picture of the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/488604681/">front view</a> of the patrolling squad.  Everyone is following the squad leader, but they are separated by a walkway made of the same material as the Vietnam Wall.  This could be a link between the two wars since it appears to be going towards the Vietnam War Memorial.</p>
<p>People have many different views on how wars or how people are.  In the case of the Lincoln Memorial, Lincoln is regarded as the greatest president this nation has ever had.  This is why he is shown as a huge God-like statue.  The Vietnam War Memorial shows the troops who lost their lives just as a list of names, that way no one can put a face to any names unless you personally knew them.  In the Korean War Memorial have life size statues next to a wall that has faces etched in it.  This way, spectators can see the ones who lost their lives.  All of this depends what the public think about the person or event that occurred in history.</p>

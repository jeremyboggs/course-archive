				<p>Washington DC the capital of the untied states. When you want to learn history then you should go to national mall in Washington DC. The national mall is an open area national park, and you can find a lot of history museums, monuments and memorials. <strong>People can receiver message from the ways the memorials design, so people can remember certain time or event in history.also people act differently in each memorial.  </strong>World War II memorial, Korean War memorial and Vietnam War memorial are three biggest memorials and also the most people go visit those three memorials in Washington DC. Those three memorials are the place I always go, because I can really a lot and also to remember them. <strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>World War II memorial is the youngest memorial in national mall. World War II memorial opened to the public on April 29, 2004, and was dedicated on May 29. As it opening, thousands of people visited the memorial from all parts of country. The memorial consists of 56 pillars, each pillar about 17 feet tall, and you can 56 states name on each pillar. 56 pillars symbolizing national unity represent the states, territories, and District of Columbia that comprised the United States during the World War II.  Between pillars there are two big memorial arches at the north and south entrance to the memorial plaza, those two arches commemorate victory from Atlantic to pacific. Walk into plaza, there is big fountains in the rainbow pool. The rainbow pool will be restored to their historic configuration. Most people visit World War II memorial, every time when I go there, and I can see people are setting there with their family. Children are running around the rainbow pool, and some kids are playing water with other people. Every one is looking so happy. I think people like to visit World War II memorial, because the United States didn’t lose war, they had big victory during World War II. However, whoever designs this memorial really wants to us remember those people who were fighting for untied states, who lost their lives during the World War II.</p>
<p>After walk short distance you can see Korean War memorial on your left side. The memorial is in the form of triangle intersecting a circle. Walk in to the memorial, there are 19 stainless steel statues stand in middle of memorial. When I walk close to the statues I can see how they look on their face, from their looking I can really tell what they were doing during the Korean War. After I saw those statues I can imagine how the war was. Behind the those statues there is 164 foot long black granite wall with photographic images sandblasted into it depicting soldiers, equipment and people involved in the war. I really like this war, because you can see how those soldiers looking during the Korean War.  People are so happy in World War II memorial, but people walk into Korean War memorial they are really act differently. They are so quit no one talking, they just walk along the war, look at the images on the war. I am sure they are really respectful in this memorial. “Freedom is not free” now I know what is really mean. Freedom is not free you really have to fight for it.</p>
<p>Vietnam War memorial is right cross reflection pool from Korean War memorial. The memorial wall is made up of two black granite walls, those walls are very similar. However, the different between those two walls is the Vietnam war wall has all veterans name on the memorial walls who dies during the Vietnam War. When a visitor looks upon the wall, his or her reflection can be seen simultaneously with the engraved names, which is meant to symbolically bring the past and present together. I am really amazing the silence in memorial, I even can hear wind blow. People just walk along with wall, and look at wall with soldiers name. people also can find book, which it has all soldiers name who die during the war.</p>
<p>After visited three memorials, and I really learn a lot. Also I really respect those people who die during the war. each memorial bring out three different emotions. Though people feeling and emotion, they find personal connection to each memorial. People are taking tour to those three memorial, they can find two different sides to war. so people can really respect soldiers respect what they done for their country.</p>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>I read three different slave advertisments. They all had one shared theme running through them. All three advertisements pertained to women who were pregnant. <strong>The advertisements suggested that preganant slaves were not treated like women with children, but instead as a piece of property with slightly more value.</strong><br />
The first thing I noticed in the adverstisement was that all of the women were dressed in &#8220;old&#8221; clothes, and in Virginia made clothes. The old clothes would suggest that their owners did not care enough about them to buy them new clothes. In addition, Virginia-made clothes would suggest that their clothing was made of cotton. Back in the days of slavery, clothes made of cotton were the cheapest clothes one could find. This is both because cotton was very abundant, and also because it is very likely that the slaves made their own clothes out of the cotton they picked.<br />
Another thing which suggested that these women were treated as pure property was the fact that some of them did not have names. In the one advertisement where the woman actually did have a name, the article said &#8220;she calls herself PAT.&#8221; Her owner in the article continually just referred to her as the &#8220;Nego Woman.&#8221; This would show that the owner did not care or respect that this woman had an identity; he could not even show her the respect of calling her by her name. This seems esepcially dehumanizing because even most housepets have a name.<br />
In addition, one side thing I noticed was that most of the women were described as being fat. This description was aside from the fact that they were pregant. This could suggest that they were indoor slaves, possibly cooks, or servants inside. The slaves who worked in the cotton fields all day probably tended to be thinner because they were doing hard labor. Also, one of the advertisements had mentioned that the slave woman was wearing a cooks apron, so that would be more evidence to confirm the hypothesis.<br />
Another thing i noticed in the advertisementswas that one of the rewards for finding these slaves was a pistols. This shows that the owners of these slaves owned guns. They could have complete domination over the slaves because they were literally armed. It would take a lot of courage to disobey or leave someone who had the power to shoot you with a gun. Hence at the same time, this fact also shows the strength of spirit that these runway women must have had to leave their owners. They knew the possible consequences of getting caught but they continued on.<br />
The article in Wikipedia said that slave were only seen as property not as humans [1]. Also the article stated that in the south slaves became the backbone of the work force [1]. The ads help enhance my understading of colonial America with regards to the reading for this week because the ads show how many of the slaves owners didnt even call their slaves by their names. This helps prove that slaves were not seen as human.  In addition, the fact that owner took the time to write the ads and were willing to pay a very high reward for the slaves return it shows that slaves were in fact very important to the slaves owners.</p>
<p>Therefore, in light of the information contained in both the advertisments and the wikipedia articles, it seems clear that slaves were dehumanized by their owners, and considered soley as property. Their indentities, feelings, and health were not important. It also seems clear that women slaves were not treated any better than males, and pregant female slaves were not treated better than non pregnant female slave either. This was obviously a low point in American history, and I am glad our country has overcome this travesty.<br />

			<p>It was kind of a relief to read your paper in the sense that it was a different subject to read. You never really hear much about the female slaves so it was new and refreshing to read. I looked at a lot of articles, but I never came across the articles of pregnant women. It is sad that colonists didn’t even have any decency to treat pregnant women with a little respect. I agree with you when you say it was dehumanizing. In reality, it is. The ads not only show the treatment of women, but instead also show the inhumane acts of colonists. The ads are just so unsettling to me. </p>
<p>Fun paper! It was really cool how you spent your time talking about certain details that I had not even thought about. For example, you talked about the clothes being made from cotton and coming from Virginia. To be completely honest, neither of those had ever crossed my mind, so it was really interesting to read about it. As well, I also thought it was nice how you added information from Wikipedia. The one thing that I thought would have made your paper better is if you would have talked more about pregnant woman and not about slaves in general. Other than that, awesome paper!</p>

			<p>You have a great thesis, good support details, and you connected it all very well. I especially enjoyed the quote that you found in one of the ads, &#8220;she calls herself PAT,&#8221; and showing that this owner didn&#8217;t address her by name. Also, I enjoyed the little sub-topic about you brought up about the pistols as reward. I wasn&#8217;t think in the sense of &#8220;they have them, they probably use them.&#8221; Silly my and my 21st century ways. </p>
<p>I ALMOST found nothing wrong with this post but you mistakenly did not include links to the ads you were talking about. Shame on you for making me do my own research! Because of this, I uncovered another little gem of knowledge <a href="http://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/saxon/servlet/SaxonServlet?source=/vcdh/xml_docs/slavery/ads/vg1789.xml&amp;style=/vcdh/xml_docs/slavery/ads/display_ad.xsl&amp;ad=v1789070038" rel="nofollow">here.</a></p>
<p>It seems that the reward for this slave was only five dollars. But that could be because she had six fingers on each hand.</p>

			<p>Although I read several different runaway slave ads, I did not read ads related to the  pregnant slaves. Because you wrote about what I did not notice, your writing was very interesting to me. I agree with your idea that the owners did not care about their slaves and only treated like a property. In my opinion, you also provide your evidence very well. Moreover, I was surprised the way you provide your evidence supporting your thesis. You captured certain details of ads such as &#8220;clothing issue.&#8221; Although every ads that I read described the details of clothes that the slaves wore, I did not pay attention to the clothes. I also did not know that Virginia-made clothes made of cotton and cotton clothes were cheapest at that time. </p>
<p>As your writing contains the information that I have not known, I really enjoyed reading it. After I read your writing, I searched ads about pregnant women runaway ads. The ads that I read also dehumanized slaves like you mentioned in your paper. Although I think your writing contains a good point, but it would be better if you explain more about pregnant slaves.</p>

			<p>After all the articles I had read, not one talked about pregnant slaves and how they were treated and that is why this is very informative to me.  I know that I have always thought that pregnant women always had an advantage and always had a bigger say.  I mean most people would think that because they have a baby inside of them right?.  And you would most certainly think that would be the case when they were slaves because the baby would probably eventually become a slave and the owner would want to treat that pregnant women better than everybody else.  But nooooo that is not how it was and that is why your paper is very interesting and something worth reading.<br />
The only problem that I had was with your thesis.  Your thesis was about pregnant women and how they were still treated like a piece of property.  Although you have given good examples and good support in your first few paragraphs, it seems to me that you got a little side tracked.  The last few paragraphs were solely about all slaves and not just pregnant slaves, which doesn&#8217;t really support your thesis statement the whole paper.  Good paper though.  Very interesting.</p>

			<p>Your post was filled with a tremendous amount of facts that I did not know about the slaves. I never would have thought that the slave owners would pay in pistols. If the slave owner had lots of guns those kinds of payments were often taken. Your post opened my eyes to the way of life and the mistreatment of the slaves. Another interesting fact I pulled from your blog was the fact that most slaves had no identity. This is highly important in showing the kind of oppression the slaves had to deal with daily.</p>
<p>I agree with your claims in your blog although your thesis is not held up well throughout the text. There were a slim number of supports for the argument of the pregnant women that I forgot that this was your main point. The post was mostly talking about the slaves in general and kind of touched on your main purpose. Maybe you should have re-worded your thesis statement because it kind of throws off the whole post.</p>

			<p>This article in particular shows us that our identity can be taken away from us in any second. While this is happening, you feel like you’re a ghost in a whole other world. What the women went through was unbelievable and no one should ever go through this. Being pregnant and doing work is very tiring even though its owners didn’t care. The owners didn’t know their name and didn’t provide nice or decent clothing for them. This just shows that the owners absolutely didn’t care for them at all. </p>
<p>Reading this article didn’t surprise me at all. Although it was very disturbing, it wasn’t new to me at all. Obviously when the owners had slaves, you just knew that they weren’t going to treat them with respect. The owners who think they are everything wouldn’t even think twice about respecting the slaves.  The slaves who did the work went through a lot and for the women who were pregnant suffered the most pain. The owners were selfish and inconsiderate and no one should ever be treated with disrespect. From the owner’s point of view, as long as whatever needs to be done is done, then everything is okay which is not right at all.</p>

			<p>I really liked your post a lot. It gave a lot of details and was very interesting. Reading about the slaves giving themselves names and the owners not even addressing them as such really brought about a good topic for discussion.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really think your facts supported your thesis though. The thesis makes me think this post is entirely about pregnant woman, however, upon reading it you talk some about woman, but mostly about how slave owners treated slaves. Perhaps you could re-word the thesis to better illustrate your blogs topic.</p>

			<p>It is awful to think that pregnant slaves were thought of as more valuable and sold when pregnant. The fact that owners would split up families and make women work right before and right after they had given birth is unbelieveable, especially when white women back then did nothing but sit on their butts. You picked a very good topic and I did like the points you made.</p>
<p>One point that I did not think you elaborated on well enough was the fact that the women were commented on as being fat. While this could mean that the women probably did work inside, I believe that the owners were most likely commenting on the fact that they were healthy. Another point that i had a problem with was the fact that the owners had pistols. While i agree that the owners were armed, I would not be surprised if some of the slaves could have gotten their hands on pistols as well. Also, I do not think that the owners would have shot there slaves because the slaves were though of as expensive property.</p>

			<p>I really liked this post and I thought it had a lot of information in it and that you read through the posts and really tried to gather all the information you could. It was interesting how you looked at pregnant women being slaves. One would think that pregnant women would be treated somewhat different, but with the information you provided that was not the case. I found that interesting since they she was having kids that the owner might care a little bit more and because he would gain control over her kids too. Its amazing how people could be treated not to long ago and you did a good job of pointing the out and making us realize that.<br />
It was well written with a lot of facts. I thought you had a lot of facts. I don&#8217;t know if you realize this, but none of your ads are linked with the article. I see the slavery link at the bottem, but I can&#8217;t see any other ones. Maybe I&#8217;m just missing it. But I would of liked to read those ads to see what you were talking about and see maybe if there was anything that you missed when you read them. Other then that it was nice to read.</p>

			<p>You brought to my attention an interesting subject.  I liked how you picked a unique topic to write about.  I agree that it is a disgrace how pregnant slaves were treated in the past.  It is devastating to see how their owners weren&#8217;t even a bit lenient towards them.  I am grateful for how much America has changed since that time.  We now know the importance of respect and equality.  I like how your thesis statement can reflect on the difference in our thoughts and conceptions today.  We pay so much more attention to pregnancy, and rejoice for a new-born life.</p>
<p>Your blog post could have been improved if you added more sources for evidence at the bottom of your post.  I was confused as to where your sources were when I clicked the one link you did provide.  Your main problem was that you did not support your thesis statement.  You state specifically that pregnant slaves who were treated unfairly was your main purpose.  However, your paragraphs can imply to all the slaves.  Either your thesis or the supporting paragraphs should have been fixed.  Overall I enjoyed reading your post!</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s crazy to see that a person&#8217;s life was once worth the same as a pistol. It makes you wonder about how people valued human life two hundred years ago, and be greatful that it isnt the same today.</p>
<p>I like the advertisements that you chose. I havent ever heard of pregnaut slaves running away before so it was interesting to read something new to me. Also, good job at adding what you read in wikipedia to your post; it really adds to the details</p>

			<p>You analyzed the articles quite well. I like how you broke down the articles into smaller parts and wrote about each part seperately. It was nice to read about why the slaves wore cotten clothes and also about how the names situation with the slaves. It is quite sad to have read that the masters wouldn&#8217;t even call them by names.</p>
<p>Your thesis talks about pregnant slave women and how they were just treated as a piece of property with a little extra value. I was expecting to read more about pregnant slave women but your post didn&#8217;t contain much information about them, I think you should have written more about that.</p>

			<p>Your article was very interesting with everything you mentioned about how slaves were treated like property. We have come to learn that through out our history studies. When I read your thesis statement though, I expected your post to be mainly about how pregnant slaves were treated the same or differently than all the other slaves. But none the less the facts given were very interesting. How the women that worked outside most probably weighed less than the women that worked inside mainly because they had a more hard labor based job, and how when a slave ran away their master would probably do anything in their power to get them back and even pay by pistols because they were regarded as expensive property and should be kept around at all times.</p>

			<p>You were right in assuming that pregnant slaves were considered to have a slightly higher value than those without children.  This is because the slave owners are thinking that they will have another slave ready to work once the pregnant slave delivers.  Your argument is very strong in the evidence you present, even though there are no links that would bring up the actual articles that you researched.  The comment about the kind of clothes that the pregnant slaves were wearing was odd.  It sounds like you were expecting that the slaves would be wearing fancy or nice clothing, even though they are considered just property.  Why would the slave owners spend more money trying to clothe his slaves?  You were right to assume that they made their own clothes, this makes sense, and you prove it by bringing up that they most likely use the cloth that they pick while they are working in the field for their owner.<br />
Back in the colonial times, the &#8220;Americans&#8221; were the dominate race, and the new slaves were just another form of property that means more wealth.  They were slaves and throughout the history of man, slaves were never treated well.  So the fact that the slave owners interacted with some of his slaves and know them on a personal level means that, in some cases, slaves in America could have had it worse.  They were taken away from their own land, from their family and brought to the unknown.  It&#8217;s unfortunate that this happened in our history, and continues to happen in the world, however, if there weren&#8217;t any slaves to do the work, then how would this nation be today?</p>

			<p>I found your post very interesting because it focused exclusively on pregnant women. I found it disturbing that these women weren&#8217;t seen as valuable people, but merely property with a tiny bit more wealth, because of the pregnancy. The idea that someone would be paid in pistols if they returned the pregnant woman is sickening, as if equating the life of a pregnant slave to a gun. However, that was the mindset back then and it was interesting to read your post since it focused on such a specific group of slaves.</p>

			<p>This post does an excellent job of showing how dehumanized slaves really were and that some were truly stripped of everything, including a name.  The hypothesis drawn from the descriptions of the slaves clothing and physical appearance were very interesting and show the author’s attention to detail.  Also, it brings to light the issue of slave pregnancy, which is something I admit I cannot remember ever thinking about.  Nevertheless,  I am sure this was a big issue back in the time of slavery.  It may have been good to mention the chances of the child being taken and sold away from his or her mother.  The most interesting aspect of this blog, however, was the fact that you could sense the author’s growing realization of exactly how brutal and inhumane the life of a slave was in Colonial America. </p>
<p>On a more critical note, the thesis of the blog is somewhat naive.   The thesis seems to imply that the author expected that pregnant slaves would be treated with some kind of respect or deference, as pregnant women are usually treated in most cultures, and that the author was surprised that slave owners would look at pregnancy merely as an economic benefit, i.e., the chance to gain another slave.  Everything in the ads, as well as all of the evidence the author of this blog discussed, should have indicated that the traditional rules of society were not observed by the slave owners when it came to slaves.  It should be no surprise that slave owners did not make allowance for pregnant slaves, as they literally did not view the slaves as humans.  If they did, the system of slavery would have collapsed long before it was abolished.</p>

			<p>I found it interesting that the pregnant slaves were not treated any different from non-pregnant slaves; I already knew that women and men slaves were treated about the same. But you seemed to jump around with your ideas. What does the slave master owning a gun have anything to do with a pregnant slave running away? The risks of being caught in general were high; I honestly don&#8217;t think a gun would elevate that risk or fear of being caught any farther. And your conclusion sentence did not fit in with the rest of your post. I&#8217;m pretty sure that everyone is glad slavery is over, but it is just irrelevant to add it in at the last minute.</p>

			<p>This post is very surprising. I am shocked and saddened to read about a person not being given the decency of being called by her name, but rather being called, “Negro Woman.” I realize that slave owners only see them as slaves, but they are people too. I love how you compare that to house pets; it shows just how dehumanizing that action really is.<br />
You do a marvelous job of thinking and hypothesizing about the articles you read. You concluded that “fat” might mean that a slave worked in the kitchen as opposed to working in the hot sun all day. And I never thought of that. Also, unlike anyone else, you mentioned the fact that pistols were given as rewards. I would think that most people back then did own a pistol, so I do not see that as very surprising to own one. (What does this have to do with your thesis though?) I agree with you that the slaves must have been very valuable and hard working to the slave owners since they were willing to pay such a high reward for them. In several articles that I have read, they are willing to pay 40 s. 41 s. like in the ad from Thomas Jefferson.   </p>
<p>You mentioned that the articles helped you to understand colonial America better and the readings for class. How though? You should have added a little more citations and quotes so we could learn too.</p>

			<p>Great post! I really enjoyed reading this. You have great insight into many small details that can quickly breeze right by most. Your post made me hate colonial slave owners even more than I already do (which I thought was impossible). To learn that pregnant women were treated the same way as other slaves disgists me. At least from the viewpoint of a slave owner, one would think that they would treat their &#8220;future money-makers&#8221; with more care.</p>
<p>The one thing I would have really liked to see in this post would be something probably impossible to find. I would&#8217;ve liked to see how babies and small children were treated. There probably isn&#8217;t any information regarding this, because  frankly babies and small children werent able to run away (without at least the help from somebody older whom the runaway ad would have been posted about). But anyway, great post!</p>

			<p>Your thesis is very interesting and unique. Narrowing the topic of your post by making it about pregnant women, rather than slaves in general, distinguished your post from the others. This grabbed my attention immediately and made the post significantly more engaging. With regard to the content of your post, I thought you did an exceptional job in trying to gain insight into the personalities of the slaves based on the Ads. One example of this was when you spoke of the courage it must have taken to run away from a slave owner that could easily kill them. The only problem with this concept is that I doubt a slave owner would offer a reward for their return to simply kill them. Unless, of course, his goal was to set an example for the other slaves not to run away. In addition, I thought you made an interesting comment on the slave’s clothing and how they might have sewn them themselves. Before I read your post, this question never crossed my mind. </p>
<p>	This post was definitely the best I have read so far; in that I cant really think of anything wrong with it other than a few grammatical errors, and the fact that you didn’t include hyperlinks to the Ads you read. Perhaps you could have written more about pregnant slaves, because after all, that was what your thesis was about. I felt you drifted away from your thesis at some points. Either way, your post was nonetheless impressive.</p>

			<p>The amount of information and inferences in your article were great. You obviously took the time to think and assess the advertisements you read. By focusing on pregnant females, your article took a different approach to slave life. I think that you are absolutely right that the slaves were dehumanized and treated solely like property. </p>
<p>Your article was very interesting and informative. However, I think grammatically if you would have made the paragraphs more compact, your point would have been illustrated easier. Your article seemed to jump from subject to subject without having transitions. It is a good post, but it could have been much better with better grammatical detail.</p>

			<p>I believe that this essay is very effective in making the point that slaves were dehumanized and treated as property. The two points made in this essay were very clear, one that slaves were given the cheapest clothing possible, clothes made in virginia, those made of cotton. The second point that slaves were most often not given names truly portrays how slaves were really considered property.</p>
<p>The only thing I believe could have been improved in this article was to expound upon some of the reasons women who were pregnant were viewed as being more valuable. The obvious is that they are carrying a child who will eventually serve the master, a second possibility could be the slave serving as a wetnurse for the slaveowners young.</p>

			<p>After reading you post, I was left in agony. I would have never thought that a pregnant slave would be treated in that sort of manner. One would think that a pregnant slave would have the upper hand and that other women slaves would want to get pregnant to avoid some of the harsh treatments their masters put them through. I guess to the master, a pregnant slave carrying a life in them was just another slave, their property after he/she is born.<br />
It is extremely sad that their owner would put them through so much harsh labor and not feeling an ounce of guilty. After all, slaves weren’t human to them but animals. </p>
<p>Unfortunately you didn’t post the Ad&#8217;s you talked about. I did my own search and the ad&#8217;s I found were agonizing and very depressing, and its gives you teary eye. I know that slaves weren’t treated right but I never thought their owners would stoop this low.</p>
<p>Your post was very striking. You supported your thesis and provided us with examples of why slaves where dehumanized and were treated like property. I enjoyed reading your post. Well done</p>

				<p>The Civil War was a very critical event in US history that can be argued was one of the most significant time periods in History.  Since the Civil War, many books and movies have either been written or made to try and present people with, what the magnitude and lifestyle was like during that specific period. Even though many different genres have been made, I am going to look at one and that is the movie “Gods and Generals”. A lot of people think that Gods and Generals is a very factual movie that simply portrays straight historical information.<strong> Gods and Generals is a historical movie that is very factual, but also is produced to have the audience of the movie, feel certain connections towards certain people and groups in the movie.</strong></p>
<p><strong>            </strong>        General “StoneWall” Jackson is a very decorative confederate general. Typically in history, he is known as being very fearless and a bit over the top on the battlefield. In this movie a different side is presented to the audience, even though they still show his fearless nature too. The movie really wants the audience to connect with General Jackson. They do this by showing his religious side all throughout the movie. General Jackson is shown praying to God many times in the movie, one time with his wife in the beginning of the movie before he leaves, another time before the battle at Manassas. This really allows the audience to feel a connection towards a certain character. During the middle of the movie they even show General Jackson growing an attachment to a little girl. They become best of friends and it is probably the most touching scenes throughout the movie. When the little girl dies of Scarlet Fever, General Jackson starts to cry and you can not help, but feel for him. From the beginning of the movie to him being shot and dying from pneumonia at the end this movie really gives you a look at not just a whole bunch of characters, but one specifically that you can have that attachment to. So because a lot of this movie is centered around him, it gives the audience that character that they like to feel for and to sympathize with.</p>
<p>A group that fought in the civil war and played a very big part was the Irish Brigade. The 69<sup>th</sup> New York which was a brigade made up mostly of Irish immigrants. The way they were portrayed in this movie was very heroic. The Irish Brigade is a group that usually gets lost in the Civil War and not a lot of people know about the contribution that they played for the Union army. The only time that the Irish Brigade is seen in the movie is during the battle at Fredericksburg. It seems to be a special part of the movie when the Irish Brigade is marching up towards the confederates facing their fellow countrymen (the Irish on the confederate side) and fighting harder and stronger or being portrayed as fighting harder and stronger then the brigades before them that went. By watching how the movie portrayed the Irish Brigade, being so courageous and fighting for something that they really had nothing to do with. They were immigrants from Ireland that came to America to try escape the same things that were being fought in the Civil War. As an audience member during the Fredericksburg battle you can really see how the Irish Brigade is appreciated in history today. This is a group that the audience can cheer for and feel sympathy for. It is almost like cheering for the underdog. Everyone likes cheering for the underdog and the Irish were the underdog in this movie. Even though the movie shows many other Brigades during the battle, the Irish Brigade is portrayed a notch higher then all of the other ones, just by seeing how the confederate army, their own countrymen take time to notice their effort and give out a cheer for them. Even after the battle a special recognition is given to them in a letter presented to the men that fought in the battle. Even though the Irish is only shown once during the movie, being defeated badly, you can not help, but to appreciate them when the movie is done. So I think only showing the Irish Brigade once and showing them being defeated was a good job by the director of the movie showing off the Irish.</p>
<p>Gods and Generals touches on a lot of different things in the movie. It gives you the historical look that makes it your usually boring history movie, but it also gives you those objects that people look to have that connection with and feel for during the movie. That is what separates this from just a plain historical movie. I would call this a historical drama movie. This is a very accurate historically, but some of the parts were altered, so it wouldn’t be that plain historic movie. The relationship between the little girl and General Jackson, I couldn’t find any information the proved that to be true, so it was just added to contribute to the character of General Jackson. The way the Irish is portrayed is also the way the director of the movie wanted to present them to the audience. So while many may argue that the movie was a disappointment or a complete waste of money to spend on a movie, the movie does a good job of picking certain things to focus the movie around and on to the audience to make it more of a movie that can be watched by not only historians, but also by people that just want to watch a feel good movie like Cold Mountain, just not as extreme as that.</p>

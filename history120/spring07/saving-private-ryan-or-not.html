				<p>Violent. Chaotic. Overwhelming. After viewing <em>Saving Private Ryan</em>, these are the three words that immediately come to mind. Yet despite the scenes of war and death, by the end of the movie the viewer is left feeling a sense of hope. A group of soldiers are sent on the task of bringing back one man to the United States, who has unknowingly lost his three brothers already, while incurring many obstacles in their search for this soldier. <em>Saving Private Ryan</em> most easily recognized theme is strewn throughout the movie; when is one life more important than another? <strong>Steven Spielberg&#8217;s critically acclaimed movie, <em>Saving Private Ryan</em>, provides a look into the sorrows, triumphs, and senselessness death of World War II through the eyes of one infantry on the search for one man.</strong></p>
<p>In the opening of the movie, anyone who is curious as to how violent this film will be is quickly thrown into, in my opinion, the most violent part of the entire film. D-day. This is shown through the eyes of soldiers storming the beaches of Normandy. These scenes continue for a long, gruesome thirty minutes complete with shots of limbs being blown off, bullets cutting threw the bodies of many men, entrails being spewn onto others, and the look of fear in the eyes of many of these men, who have probably never seen battle, let alone so much death around them. Spielberg uses these opening scenes not only to evoke a feeling of sadness and loss, but also to make people understand that the way these men died was horrible and senseless.</p>
<p>Although the film, especially the opening scenes at D-day, hope to make the viewer understand the death and destruction as horrible and overall pointless, the main goal is not to say that the role of the United States in WWII was not needed or important. On the contrary, I believe the main point of the movie is to depict the overall senselessness in war itself. In a movie review about <em>Saving Private Ryan, </em>James Berardinelli states,&#8221;<em>Saving Private Ryan</em> quickly  and brutally dispels the notion that war is anything but vicious, demoralizing violence that makes a  cruel joke out of the human body and spirit.&#8221; While the U.S. was needed and, I believe, made the right decision in joining the side of the Allies, it is the immense loss of life that could have been prevented had the disagreements and issues never been allowed to escalate to the point of an all-out war in Europe. <em>Saving Private Ryan</em> takes this idea and puts it into a story of what some would call heroic, some would call ridiculous, idea to save one man.</p>
<p>Another scene which really hits home with the unfair loss of life is a scene in which the group, led by Tom Hanks&#8217; character, is walking through a field, continuing their journey to find Private Ryan. Unfortunately, the come upon a group of German men, presumably left to guard this particular area, and are immediately drawn into battle. After a few minutes of fighting, the U.S. soldiers are successful, but not without the loss of one of their men. In this scene is the main controversy between the remaining six men of the group about what exactly it is they are doing and if it is even important. It is here the viewers cannot help but be torn themselves. Why should this man have to die, and consequently many of the others, just to potentially save another? This is also the first time in the movie the viewer really begins to feel for the characters. Tom Hanks&#8217; character is a school teacher normally, with a wife and children, and many of the other characters share their lives and family stories throughout the movie and as a human, you cannot help but feel extreme sorrow when they are killed one after another.</p>
<p>Finally, after what feels like an eternity, the group finds Private Ryan. Adding insult to injury, Ryan, played by Matt Damon, refuses to leave. He speaks about the duty he has to his fellow soldiers and the duty he has to himself. Also a very powerful quote in the movie, he states, &#8220;Tell my mother I stayed here with the only brothers I have left.&#8221; Here the viewer cannot help but admire and, at the same time, just simply be angry with him. One of the soldiers displays this emotion by angrily telling off Ryan, explaining those who have died to get to him and all the sacrifices they have made to reach this point. This scene brings about emotions and the conflict that is war. Spielberg purposely wants this to happen so the viewer can feel the conflict and confusion these soldiers felt. While they have essentially completed their task and can finally breathe a sigh of relief, the men are thrown another curve ball and must deal with yet another problem.</p>
<p>While Spielberg uses emotion as a main way to bring about his theme in the movie, there are also many aspects which really give it credibility as well. For instance, the weaponry used throughout the movie is very accurate to what would have been used in the real combat. Also, the shooting was done very well. In the D-Day invasion at the beginning of the movie, they shot a lot of shots with hand held cameras. Berardinelli also makes points about some of the cinematography when he states they used, &#8220;hand-held cameras, a slight  speeding up of the images, muted colors, and several different kinds of film stock.&#8221; All these factors helped to create the realistic scenes in the movie and left the viewers feeling like they could have actually been there.</p>
<p>In the end, Ryan does in fact make it out alive, but not without the cost of many men, among them Tom Hanks character. The viewer is left wondering whether or not it is all worth it.<br />
Overall, Steven Spielberg does a great job capturing the hearts of the audience throughout the movie in many different scenes. As a human being, you cannot help but feel for these characters as they struggle to complete a mission that has proven itself impossible. The question, who is more important, is never really answered and is left up for the viewer to decide. The one thing you are left with at the conclusion however, is a strong sense of remorse that these men died, that so many men died, in something that could have been prevented. War, whether seemingly necessary or not at the time, is not the &#8220;right&#8221; answer and the deaths of so many prove this in <em>Saving Private Ryan</em>.</p>

			<p>Good Post! After reading this post, I have learned a lot about this movie. When this movie first came out, I didn’t watch this movie because during that time, a lot of war related movies came out and I wasn’t interested in watching any movies that was war related. I heard a lot of great things about this movie though. Reading this post, this movie sounds very moving and I think I saw the beginning of this movie awhile back. What I like about this post is that the post author points out that “These scenes continue for a long, gruesome thirty minutes complete with shots of limbs being blown off, bullets cutting threw the bodies of many men, entrails being spewn onto others.” No matter what, all war related movies will have a lot of violence. So the audience should be aware of that. What I didn’t like about this post is that it was more of a movie review than a critique. The goal of this movie review was to critique it so that you can have a better understand of this movie.</p>

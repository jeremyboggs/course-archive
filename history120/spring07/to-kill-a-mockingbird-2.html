				<p>In the movie &#8220;To Kill A Mockingbird,&#8221; there are many issues that are brought up, including the very prominant issue of race and prejudice. The movie takes place in Maycomb, a small town in Southern Alabama in the 1930s. This coming of age tale follows the life of Scout  and Jem Finch, as they grow up in a small southern town during the Depression, amidst clear racism and prejudice against those in different social classes. <strong>In this paper, I intend to show that The Finch family, among other characters in the movie, rise above the current time of racism and the Depression, simply by living out their lives in respectable, positive manner.</strong> Although every character in the movie is faced with these hardships, they come together as a family and also as a community to survive.</p>
<p>Because the movie is set in a small town in Alabama, the mind automatically assumes that everyone there is racist, and that black people are not going to be treated with any respect. This is no the case with the Finch family. Although the father, Atticus Finch, is middle-aged white attorney, he shows clear respect for members of the black community. When Atticus believes that Tom Robinson, a young black male, as been falsey accused of rapping a white woman, he takes the case and becomes Tom&#8217;s lawyer. The fact that they lose the case shows not that Atticus is bad lawyer or did not try his best to win the case, but that the town they live in is still overwhelming racist that all they saw was a black man raping a white woman, Mayelle Ewell, even if they evidence says otherwise. The amoung of people there to support Tom Robinson was overwhelming larger than the group there to support Mayella. Although all of the people there for Tom were shoved high up in what was designated the “colored balcony” you could see the love and support that held strong through their community in times of need. Clearly they knew that Mr. Robinson was being falsely accused of this rape because he was black, not because they had enough actual evidence to actually prove that he had commited a crime. Even Atticus’s children, Jem and Scout, sat in the “colored balcony” to watch the trial.</p>
<p>Although Atticus lost the case, a large portion of his town were simply upset that he took the case to begin with. Bob Ewell, the father of the alleged rape victim, was livid with Atticus for taking the case. He felt betrayed because he truly believed that Tom Robinson did not deserve a good defense because he was black. Even after Atticus lost the case, Bob Ewell attacked Jem and Scout on their way home from a school play one night, almost killing the son, Jem. Boo Radley, a man the children had long been terrified of and had heard many stories about his past, was the one to come to their rescue and save Jem’s life. He proved himself to be a kind, remarkable man, not this picture of evil and insanity the children had always thought him to be.</p>
<p>Physical dangers were not the only threats in the lives of the people of Maycomb, but the threats of the Depression also played a role in threatening their everyday lives. Many people in the town had barely any money and were forced to pay for goods with other goods that they grew or made themselves. The father of a boy the Scout and Jem went to school with, Walter Cunningham, was poor and thought of as white trash. When  his father needed to pay Atticus for some legal work he had done for him, he had no money to pay him, and so he paid Atticus in the only way he could, with a large sack of nuts. Atticus graciously accepted, and thought nothing of it that he was receiving payment not in the form of money, but in food. Because Atticus seemed not to be bothered by this, it was clear that his was a common practice during this time, seeing as people had so little money, they simply paid any way that they could.</p>
<p>I found it very interesting to compare what was considered to be the norm and O.K. then, to what we are used to today. Today, in order for someone to be convicted of a crime, especially such a serious crime as rape, there has to be lots of difinitive evidence, such as DNA evidence, fingerprints, and multiple eye witnesses. That was clearly not the case during the time period of this movie. Today nobody would let you pay them in vegetables or hazelnuts if you did some legal work for them, but then that was the only way a lot of people had to pay, and it was perfectly fine and accepted. The stark contrast between the norms of then and today are very clear, though the idea of compassion and morality is something I hope is still present today, as it was back then.</p>
<p>The Finch family defies every stereotype of a white family in southern Alabama in the 1930s would have. Atticus himself was a kind, caring man who did not see just black and white, and also taught his children to think the same way. Through his actions, he made is clear that not every white man was racist, and also showed that many white people were prejudice against the black community for no good reason at all. The lessons he taught his children, and the lessons his children learned not only from him, but form his community, shaped them into the wonderful people we would want them to be. Though it was clear that living in the south during the Depression and amidst such strong racism was not an easy thing, the Finch family rises above it to show that not everyone must be defeated by such negative thoughts, and equality and peace of mind were not that far away.</p>

			<p>I remember reading the book in high school which brings a lot of questions about racism in the south. This post does bring a lot of good points that states that not every white person is racist. What Atticus Finch did was very thoughtful. At that time setting, being a white person defending a black man was very rare. Due to the differences of their skin color, it has changed people views on the whites and blacks. I also support the fact that since this movie was made awhile ago, racist was much of a bigger issue then it is today. The time difference is very far apart and that is why I respect this movie because of its true background.</p>
<p> This post did bring a lot of good points which states what people thought of each other because of their skin color. This post was very well written and well thought. What they could have improved on is the fact that they basically told us the summary of the movie instead of just giving the gist of it. They should’ve elaborated more on what the issue is and what it has done in history.</p>

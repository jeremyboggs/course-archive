				<p>February 27th, 2007 by Neil Kelly</p>
<p>       My utopia Freedomtown will enjoy the right to practice whatever religious beliefs they want, so long as their religion abides by our peaceful laws, which strictly prohibit violence, stealing, and any other wrongful acts committed against our people. Citizens who are agnostic or atheist are also welcome in our community too. Citizens who are not respectful of other people’s various religious beliefs will be reprimanded and asked to leave our community if the problem persists.</p>
<p>          Our community is set up in a way that encourages individuality and respects the differences of everyone. These differences in ideas and beliefs should be respected by all, and everyone should learn to get along with everyone. Everyone in our town will be regarded as equal, regardless of race, religion, and gender. We would also like to be known as the community with the lowest crime rate. <strong>The ultimate goal of Freedomtown is too create a community with a variety of different people with various religious philosophies to all live peacefully together.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>         Due to our community’s vast differences in beliefs our community realizes the challenges of our town being considered a utopia. However, once people understand the way of life of Freedomtown they will see that it is achievable. Our community encourages the idea of expressing yourself and ideas openly. No religion is seen as right or wrong in the eyes of the community. All townspeople will learn to respect the differences of religious beliefs and opinions, and if certain people cannot abide by this than they will be forced to leave our community. </p>
<p>         Freedomtown will be a mix of urban and rural communities. Our town has its industrial factories located across the river separated from our farms, houses, and public buildings. We have a couple of parks and one big one that will be the social gathering spot for our various events. Our community will be a capitalist economy, which will allow people to own businesses and create revenues as long as it is done peacefully without exploiting people. Our businesses will be allowed to import and export goods to and from other communities. Freedomtown will be a mix of agricultural and industrial businesses, and taxes will be administered in order to pay our public officials and to improve our community as necessary. Social events will be held in the parks every weekend, which will allow the town to get together and socialize around music, beer, and dancing. Everyone is expected to go, but the choice belongs to the residents of our community.  </p>
<p>         Our community will have no one leader in charge instead it will be a leader-by-committee, which will consist of 12 people. The 12 people will be voted in by the people and remain on the board for no longer than 7 years. The rules of Freedomtown are strictly enforced by our town police department. Our town will also have judges that will listen to cases involving residents who have broken laws. The judges will have absolute power and have the ultimate deciding factor of whether or not it is necessary to ban the resident for his act. If a person has been declared banned from the community, he or she has the chance to appeal to a panel of 3 judges. If two out of the three Judges rule in favor of banning the resident than that person must leave Freedomtown within 3 days. A person who is banned may be allowed to come back to the community after 5 years but must have a majority vote approved by the 12 leaders of the community.</p>

			<p>You again had a very similar simutopia configuration as I did. I also set it up so that the factories and homes and land were separate. It allows people to make their own decisions about what they want to do and how they plan to earn their living. You spend a lot of your time talking about how anyone is welcome, which is a good thing. I liked how your community doesn’t discriminate and that “everyone in our town will be regarded as equal, regardless of race, religion, and gender.” I like how you threw that one in!</p>
<p>Your post was really good and I enjoyed reading it. You talked about a variety of different things right down to the people who run the place. As well, I liked how you ad the big park in the middle, it is kind of like the “glue of the community.” It is a way to bring everybody together. The only comment I have to make is that I wish you would have included a little more about the role that the roads play and other things in your simutopia! Awesome post!</p>

			<p>I enjoyed reading about this post and I thought everyone being treated as equals is the best part. Everyone should be treated as equals and your Utopia is exactly right about that. I think it will make the people in your community happier and better off because of it because they won&#8217;t have to worry about being discriminated because they might be different. Also, the idea of the people being able to express their ideas openly is good because it will be like everyones opinions matter and will be heard.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I like the idea of have a 12 person committee running the Utopia. First off it should probably be an odd number for voting within the 12 so there can&#8217;t be tie. I guess I just like the idea of one leader and I like how that works. I don&#8217;t know if having 12 will work out that well. It just seems to me that there will be more problems because of it then good done. Because your Utopia is based so much on Individualism it seems to me that of these 12 people that there could be a bunch of controversy when it comes to voting on things that not much would get resolved. Since everyone will probably have their own ideas and opinions about things. Just my take on it</p>

			<p>If you can create a community in which equallity is true, it would be great. Unfortunatly, some religions have the mandate to &#8220;save&#8221; those of other religions. You have a systen to deal with those that try to force a religion through violence, &#8220;so long as their religion abides by our peaceful laws.&#8221; But what law can stop those from speaking their mind on the &#8220;barbaisms&#8221; of other religions. There is nothing wrong with your plan at all, it&#8217;s people that have the problem. If it was really possible to have a utopia, I would think that there would be one set up by now.</p>

			<p>I really like that you got into this assignment so much. I felt that you really created a new community, with new views on politics. One thing that stud out from your blog post was that you emphasized religion from the very beginning. That was also a big issue with the United states when it was in its beginning stages. Your design was very interesting as well, the way you put that factorys across the river as almost to seclude the workers and shelter them while there where at work to get more work done. I enjoyed your creativeness in this Post, it really set it apart from others.</p>

			<p>I really enjoyed your blog post a lot.  I love how you made your utopia based on the fact that everyone should be treated as equals and respected as one too regardless of their race, religion, and gender.  I liked how you talked about a lot of different things as well.  You didn&#8217;t just focus on the people&#8217;s religion&#8217;s and how their all going to cope with that.  You described how the community is going to be run and the consequences of a person who breaks the laws.  It actually seems like the perfect community.  I also liked how you made the huge park right sqaure in the middle of your community.  I think it is a great way for social gatherings and to keep everyone in your community busy with the good things and away from the bad things.</p>
<p>The only thing that I can say needs a little work is your conclusion.  You didn&#8217;t really wrap up all you information at the end.  But other than that it was a really good post and really well written</p>

			<p>My utopian community also voices on equality.  Similarly, mine has no right or wrong religion and centers on peace.  I agree that it is very important to respect other&#8217;s views and come to an agreement on conflicts.  This is why there are two representatives or leaders in my community that will meet to discuss any disagreements.  They will overlook the community and make suggestions for changes with the agreement of a popular vote from the people.  I like how you built your utopian community to focus on the rights of everyone as an individual.  It is hard even today to voice our opinion and judgments sometimes because of the negativity that might come along with it.</p>
<p>Although I do agree with how you built your utopia, I feel that forcing the people to leave that do not abide by your rules is not a good idea.  There should be a punishment for them made by a vote of the people because sending someone away will not fix the problem.  Even though it is important to maintain a peaceful community, it is also important to work through problems together.  How will you know that this person has not returned?  What if this person comes back for revenge?  These are all possibilities to think about because if this happens it may stir up more conflict.</p>

			<p>I feel as if your visions were not really new but your way of governing has a great twist. I like the fact that one person does not govern. I also like the fact that those twelve people are elected by the people. The idea that people are banned from Freedomland might cause problems, such as people illegally coming in or committing crimes but it is a good idea to ban people that are unruly.<br />
One thing missing was who was to elect and watch over the police. Would the police be elected? Who would watch over them to make sure that they are not corrupt? Another thing I did not agree with was the fact that the judges had complete power over who stays and who goes? I feel that if we do have judges, there should be one for each religion and/or race represented because otherwise it could cause bias.If bias is committed who will repremand or watch over the judges. I think the best thing about our country is the checks and balances, which is the only thing I did not see too much of. Your blog was very good and I agreed with everything you said!</p>

			<p>I think this is close to one of the most realistic towns there were. I like how the factories are away from the homes and farms to keep from contaminating the the crops or harming the children. I do however think that it will be very difficult for all of these religions to get along with eachother.</p>

			<p>A community that has all religions welcome is an awesome idea, except that it would be very difficult to live in a community where a group of people would completely disagree in what you believe.  The idea is good but executing it would prove to be the challenge.  I just had a couple of unanswered questions:  Can the be re-elected after the 7 years?; What happens when the committe votes to a tie?; Who selects the judges in your community?; Would the entire family be kicked out or just the one person?<br />
I like the idea about the weekly gatherings in the social area.  But again, with the consumption of alcohol and having different religions or ideas in the same area would be interesting to witness.  I do not like the whole kicking people out of the community thing.  This would create a bias in the community and then there will be social differences among the citizens who voted them out and those who did not.  I don&#8217;t think that the person voted out would want to come back after 5 years of living somewhere else. I was also difficult to comprehend your utopia since it wasn&#8217;t commented.</p>

			<p>Your Utopian idea is great, and thats what it is, a utopia because that would never happen. I agree with you and think that it would be awesome to live like that though. It is very hard though to stop people from displaying dislike towards someone, especially to someone different than they are. You cannot stop someone from thinking or forming an opinion about someone and generally they will tell that opinion to someone close to them. We try to stop that in our world today; in small clubs they try for that but it just never works sadly. You say you can express yourself openly, but you have to accept everyone&#8230;this is strange. If you think something about someone, you are not allowed to express that thought, but you are encouraged to express yourself&#8230;?<br />
The work and leisure aspect of the town sounds great. I like the idea of the town gatherings on the weekends. This would create something for people to do on days off and lead to less crime, since people are &#8220;off the streets.&#8221; Great job on detailing the punishment part. I like the idea that if someone does not abide by the rules, kick them out. Why punish them and keep them when they could just do it again.</p>

			<p>It is very smart to allow religious freedom. People should be free to believe whatever they want as long as it is in a positive manner. Humans need to fear a god or else they will cause problems, and eventually weaken a community. I like how the people have freedom to do whatever they want, as long as they do no evil. Utopias cant be called utopias if there are repeat trouble makers, so I think it is a good thing to kick them out. But, of course, everyone deserves second chances as your post implies. Basically every aspect of your utopia is like mine. Pretty much everything has a logical reason for it, and is realistic. I can tell that you put a fair amount of thought into your utopia. The only thing is that the panel should have an odd number of people so that they don’t end in a tie and decisions are made.</p>

			<p>I enjoyed reading the description of your town. It seems real inviting, and equal to all. Allowing people to practice there own religions and living in the same community is a good touch. Also mentioning that it is important to follow the laws  of the town while beleiveing in ones relgion is also a good point. Overall I enjoyed your description of the simtopia. Good job.</p>

			<p>Your “Freedomland” sounds like a great place to live. I also separated my work from home and created a large park area for everyone to enjoy. The only hesitation I would have living there is although it sounds like a perfect place to live, is it to perfect? In America everyone is welcome but our country still has problems and different religions and races still don’t get along. If everyone followed your rules I think it would be a utopia. But I also think that America was supposed to run like your “Freedomland” and we didn’t necessarily go that way.</p>

			<p>Your utopia community really felt different and unique when I read about it. With the different stances on the political issues it stuck out from others. Your utopia really sounds like a pleasant place to reside. I agree with other comments that it sounds too perfect and that might cause problems within the society. And its true that even though everyone is welcome with all different backgrounds in religion, race and ethnicity there are always problems among people.</p>

			<p>I really liked the idea of your utopia, since it seems so different. I agree in that I do think it would work. I like the way that it is spread out, but still close together; it looks well thought-out. I also liked the aspect of the 12 person committee and the banning of citizens found guilty by the judges. The option to come back with permission of the judges is also unique, and something that I liked about Freedomtown.</p>

			<p>I think its very important and love that you started your blog  off talking about the freedom of religion. While we do enjoy this freedom in the United States, many people choose not to respect that and I like that you made it an important factor in your community. I also like that you mixed rural and urban communities. When I made my utopia, this is a lot how I imagined mine to be.</p>
<p>My main praise is also my main critizism. As much as I like the idea of all types of religions living and working together as one, it&#8217;s hard for me to believe that this could actually work. With radicals in each and every religion, it could be hard to maintain the peace in Freedomland.</p>

			<p>I found your post to be very refreshing. I like the idea of haviing everyone respect eachother, including their religious beliefs. I found it very key to your post that the aspect of individuality is so important. But I do have to ask, is that realistic? I know this is your idea of eutopia, and obviously it is not realistic otherwise we would all live in a perfectly peaceful world, but I thought it was important to include that althought this society is ideal, it is also not tangable.</p>

			<p>I enjoyed reading your post. Your community sounds great. Your community is similar to the United States. The United States practices freedom of religion but with that in mind there is alot of controversy. The United State may practice freedom of religion but they really dont follow it. We have so many people that do not respect this.</p>
<p>Our simutopia has one similarity a big park in the center. So that in the end of the day, it bring everyone together. All in all, I really liked your utopia. It was very simple with the essentials that would make the community a great one. I really think your post was well-written. Good job!</p>

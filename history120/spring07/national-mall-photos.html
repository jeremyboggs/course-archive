				<p>Monuments are designed in order to remember an important person or event. They show significance or importance. Washington is a city built around monuments. Because of its importance as a city, it is the capitol of country and has is leading world power, it carries even more meaning and memories. The wars, marches, and elections all have significant connection to Washington D.C. <strong>The National Mall in Washington DC is an important landmark beacuse it carries some of the most influential monuments in American history.</strong> This piece of land that is stretched out from the capitol until the Washington Monument is full of memorials that represent important dates and people in the United States history.</p>
<p>The first memorial I visited was the Washington Monument. The reason I choose to visit this memorial was because I felt it was one of the most famous landmarks in Washington DC. Its notables height helps attract many visitors. At the date of its completed construction it was announced to be the tallest structures in the world. Today, although it is not the tallest, it remains to be on the tallest stonework structures. Its structure also attracts curiosity. People when passing by always want to know what is going on around and inside it. To add to this, this structure is memorial for the first president of the United States. This makes it one of the most important memorials in the Washington DC area. For these reasons I decided the Washington Monument was a necessity to add to the list of memorials.</p>
<p>The second memorial I visited was the World War II memorial. I decided to visit this memorial for two reasons. The first one was because this was the first real World War that the United States had been involved in after it had gained its independence and recognition as a country. The second reason was because this war helped put the United States as one of the world leading powers. It helped show their strength and capability. This war made America what it is today. This memorial recognized all the states in America, and it recognized all the soldiers that died for America. I thought along with the Washington Monument, this memorial shows anther great turning point in American history.</p>
<p>The third memorial I visited was the Lincoln memorial. This one was my favorite of them all. The reason I choose this was because I am a big fan of Abraham Lincoln. I believe that as a president he really worked hard in shaping the American society. He was practical and realistic. He wanted peace and equality for his people. As a president, I think he contributed more in influencing the American society. Also, this landmark had anther significance. It was where Martin Luther King had his famous ‘I had a dream’ speech. This landmark is also adds to the turning points in American history.</p>

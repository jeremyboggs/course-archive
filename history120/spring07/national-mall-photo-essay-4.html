				<p>The National Mall is composed of many monuments and memorials. As you look at the different memorials you notice different design and structure. Each one of these monuments is designed differently. <strong>When looking at monuments on the national mall can we understand what the artist wants us to see. </strong>It is not hard to jump to conclusions and come up with many ideas which you think represent what the memorial is designed for us to see.</p>
<p>When looking at the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/organize/?start_tab=sets">Lincoln memorial</a> you walk up to the front and you see long steps which lead to giant pillars. The monument is designed to represent a graceful feeling as you walk up the steps to take a look at our 16<sup>th</sup> president. With the bright colored marble it’s a welcoming atmosphere; you see this by all the classy artwork. By classy I mean all the steps which you must climb to pay your respects to Abraham Lincoln. The roman designed pillars, which where considered a place of worship. All these things lead to an understanding that this man did a lot for the country and should be celebrated. As everybody know Martin Luther King also gave his I had a dream speech there which makes this place a historical place over and over again.</p>
<p>When you visit the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/organize/?start_tab=sets">Korean memorial</a> you notice a black wall from far way. This feels like a deterrent as something bad had happened it this war. You walk up to the black wall and notice no names just faces. Some of these faces are sad and some show no emotion. It seems like this war was not war that had many words, just reactions. When you look at the statues of soldiers walking you get a sense that there are very unhappy to be in this war. You notice that they are worn our and beat up. This is resembled by there heavy boots and there long rain coats. Looking at most of there faces again they show no emotion a lack of responsiveness.</p>
<p>When I visited the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/organize/?start_tab=sets">World War II memorial</a> you feel a sense of pride. The water running, great big waterfalls, and a perfectly even oval pool. You see the smaller memorials which represent the fleet ships which fought for us, and the two fleets are divided by the Atlantic and the Pacific. When looking at this great view you also notice the famous quote from FDR. It is outdoors and the sun shines bright on this memorial and you feel a sense of accomplishment as well as victory.  Everything is set into place when you vist this great marble.</p>
<p>As you visit different memorials you notice different feelings, and can be certain the designer of the momerial wanted you to think a certain way. As you gaze at differnt momerials you get a sense of what other people are also feeling and then can be certian that the artits as done his or her job.</p></p>

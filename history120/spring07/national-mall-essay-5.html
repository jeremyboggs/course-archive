				<p>The monuments that I chose for the National Mall photo essay were the Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, and the Jefferson Memorial. I chose these because of the presidential theme, and their close proximity to one another. <strong>The three monuments I chose were purposefully positioned in a symmetrical way to each other, in order to create an underlying theme of connection between them</strong>.  For instance, the Lincoln Memorial is directly west of the Washington monument, and the Jefferson memorial is located directly south of it. It seems that this was set up this way, with the Washington Monument being the centerpiece of it all.  The monuments/memorials were set up in order to remember these presidents who greatly contributed to our country’s current position.</p>
<p>The Washington Monument took 40 years to complete its original construction due to a lack of funds. The project was interrupted by the Civil War. The monument was authorized by Congress in 1833, and was not completely finished until 1884 (<a href="http://www.watch.pair.com/">www.watch.pair.com</a>). It is one of tallest masonry structures and stands 555 feet, and is made up of marble, granite, and sandstone. At the time it was the world’s tallest structure displaying our nation’s great appreciation for George Washington. The location of the Washington monument symbolizes the importance of George Washington, and this monument is one of the most recognizable structures in the world. The Washington monument was strategically placed in the center of the National Mall, and is elevated on higher ground so the monument can be seen from basically all parts of Washington D.C., and surrounding areas. The fact that the Washington monument by law must be the tallest structure in D.C. solidifies its importance, and shows great respect towards the monument. The Washington Monument is a clear symbol of our country’s 1<sup>st</sup> great leader.</p>
<p>Robert Mills, the architect behind the project designed the monument with a blend of Greek, Babylonian and Egyptian architecture. I believe the monument has a religious undertone to it. The fact that the there is a pyramid at the top which points to the sky could be a deliberate symbol of a divine structure. The structure also sits alone on an elevated hill, in a sense looking down on D.C., and watching over D.C., I also see this as another symbol of the Washington monument being the heart of D.C., and to respect George Washington for being our country’s 1<sup>st</sup> leader. The structure is dominating in comparison to other memorials and structures in the District. When outside of the monument you can’t help but feel small, when looking up at the structure you can feel the power of it as it towers over you.  It was designed to be our national structure that would represent our country, which is evident by the 50 flags surrounding the monument representing each state. The official monument of Washington has the shape of an Egyptian obelisk, and I found out that at the top of the cap of the monument the two words “Laus Deo” exist, which in Latin means Praise be to God. These words are placed on top of D.C.’s highest structure in the most powerful city in the world. Another interesting fact is that the Jefferson memorial is to the south, the Capital to the East, and the Lincoln memorial is to the west, which could resemble a cross. This is another sign that possibly these monuments had a religious undertone to them and that there is a reference to God. This makes sense because our country was founded on a Judeo-Christian theology.</p>
<p>The Lincoln Memorial, which was built on the National Mall was architecturally designed by Henry Bacon, and was opened to the public in 1922. The memorial is similarly designed to a Greek Doric temple. It has 36 columns, which represented the 36 states at the time of Lincoln’s death. The Lincoln memorial was dedicated in 1922 to honor President Lincoln. The statue is surrounded by engraved readings of the Gettysburg address. The Lincoln Memorial is shaped like the Parthenon. The statue of Lincoln is 12 ft high and has Lincoln positioned so that he is staring towards the White House. Lincoln is sitting down in a contemplative state. The Lincoln memorial has an opening in the North and South parts of the memorial which could symbolize the Civil War, with Lincoln in the middle, trying to bring our country together at the time. One of the noticeable inscriptions in the memorial was<em> “ this temple, as in the hearts of the people for whom he saved the Union, the memory of Abraham Lincoln is enshrined forever”. </em></p>
<p>The Jefferson Memorial is located on the Tidal Basin and was finished in 1943. The white marble building was designed by John Russell Pope, and is a circular structure with a domed ceiling, surrounded by 26 columns, and a 19 ft. statue of Jefferson. It is a classical design modeled after Jefferson’s design of the Rotunda of the University of Virginia, which Jefferson based on the Pantheon in Rome (google.com) The 26 ionic columns symbolize the 26 states in the Union at the end of Jefferson’s terms as president. The triangular section over the entrance to the memorial represents the 5-man committee assigned by the Continental Congress to draft the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson is posed as if he was addressing the Continental Congress, and in his left hand he holds a copy of the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson looks out from the interior of the memorial towards the White House. There is also various writings of Jefferson carved along the interior walls of the memorial. Jefferson’s famous quote in the memorial is “<em>I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man”.</em></p>
<p>Some of the similarities I noticed in the monuments were obviously the classic Greek/Roman designs of the monuments. Although I love the look of all the monuments/memorials, I wondered why they wouldn’t have had a more modern look to them. Also, the columns representing the number of states that were present during the president’s tenure was interesting. All of the memorials seem to be juxtaposed in order to get the feel that they are all connected, which makes the memorials more powerful. The fact that they all surround the Washington monument symbolizes that George Washington was the 1<sup>st</sup> leader of this country but that Jefferson and Lincoln both followed in his footsteps and made a huge impact on the development of the U.S. I still believe that the monuments were placed strategically to represent a cross, symbolizing our nation’s belief in God. I think that would be silly if in fact this was the case, but I wouldn’t be surprised because of the importance placed on Religion.</p>

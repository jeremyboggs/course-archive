				<p>I saw the movie Jarhead and it was a movie about a marine who goes through extensive training and then is shipped out to the first Gulf war to protect the oil from the Iraqis.  <strong>History is always interpreted differently by everyone while using the author’s views where he/she could leave out some parts.  </strong><br />
This movie has a classical example of how the author, but in this case the producer only focused on his views about the situation.  While watching the movie I was only able to see American soldiers through out the movie.  As stated in history there were twelve other countries that sent out forces to Kuwait to protect the oil.  This piece of history was not shown in the movie and they could have had many reasons, one that I think is that the producer wanted to focus on the American troops only. <br />
By doing this the producer Sam Mendes does a fantastic job by only focusing on the Americans, so this way there is no confusion and he could go in-depth with the troop members.  While talking about the American troops he focuses on Jamie Foxx’s troops so this way there are only a few characters to focus on while staying on the bigger picture of war.  By telling us stories about each soldier, it plays a huge impact on the viewer’s emotions and feelings.  While doing this he does cut out the part where shooting and death occurred in the war but this was cut out because the few soldiers that he focused on never experienced any of those situations.  This is a yet another example of how the producer only shot scenes from his point of view.<br />
Another reason the producer puts only certain scenes in the movie while producing the movie is because of box office numbers.  This also brings up another point about who the movie was made for in other words the audience.  In this case the movies ratings came out to “R” this is because of pervasive language, some violent images and strong sexual content.  This automatically only admits 18+ unless their parents buy the tickets.  Violence made this movie R rated and may be the language that was used in the movie makes it R.  So the audiences were picked right since little kids don’t have any interest in those sorts of movies about war and violence.  The producer keeps his promise about violence because there is one scene which was really moving for the audience.  This was when Jake was walking around in the desert and finds a huge spot where there had been a biochemical attack and everything was burned down to the ground.  The scene had a huge impact on me and the producer put a little spin to get more emotions out when Jake threw up because of what he saw.  Another scene was where it rained oil and how the troops had to sleep through it. <br />
This was a drama movie since it talked about a war and it always kept the audience on their feet because it could be the last time that soldier was breathing.  This was an excellent movie since it had history facts and a story to follow it.  This is all because of the producer, who only put his views into the movie because if it was only history facts it would have been classified as a boring movie and not done really well in the box office.<br />

			<p>Good post! I saw this movie a while back and actually enjoyed it because I’m not really into war related/military movies. The post author clearly tells us what the whole movie is about and the motive. What I like about this movie post is that it was clear and easy to follow. This post author in particular demonstrated how a movie is filmed through a director’s eye which is different from the other posts that I have read in the past. What we see in a movie has their own reason why it is recorded like that. I like how the post author mentions that the motive of the movie is to protect the oil from the Iraqis. “a marine who goes through extensive training and then is shipped out to the first Gulf war to protect the oil from the Iraqis.” What I didn’t like about this post is that the post author mainly discussed the summary of this movie and the movie ratings. There were a few grammatical mistakes that I found while reading this post. For example “I saw the movie Jarhead and it was a movie about…”</p>

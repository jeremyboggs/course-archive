			<div class="entry">
				<p>Today in the United States certain stereotypes are used arguably for less nefarious reasons than they were in the nineteenth century. That is not to say, however, that modern day stereotypes are any more positive or constructive than those of our past. The stereotype of the lazy, drunken and brawling Irish &#8220;goon&#8221; who looked more like an animal is not significantly more positive to the Irish reputation than the more recent stereotype of the Irish party animal. The difference is that the purposes behind these respective uses of stereotyping are almost complete opposites. <strong>Generally speaking, the &#8220;cultural work&#8221; performed by stereotypes in the nineteenth century was to assist in efforts to exclude and marginalize particular groups who sought acceptance within the American experience, while the &#8220;cultural work&#8221; performed by stereotypes today seems more akin to &#8220;marketing support&#8221; work, aimed at attaching some well known collective attribute to various consumer products for all to enjoy. </strong>While the caricature of the Irish goon was designed and used to keep the Irish outside the bounds of decent American society, the &#8220;party Mick&#8221; is now constantly used to lure others into the happy drinking ways of this lovable member of the big American quilt.</p>
<p>While it would be naive to suggest that there are no longer efforts to exclude and marginalize various groups within the US, it is clear that America is longer a place where overt racism<strong> </strong>can be practiced in the media to the extent it once was in the nineteenth century. The level of social consciousness and moral restraints on overt racism has increased significantly from days ago, and the fact is many ethnic groups that were once on the outside looking in have now worked their way into the current American mainstream. Thus, while attempts to negatively influence the American public’s acceptance of a particular group by way of a blatant stereotype broadcast widely in the mainstream media may have been tolerated in the nineteenth century, they would most likely be regarded as heavy-handed and morally unacceptable in today’s America. In other words, racism and the use of stereotypes in support of racism, must be much more subtle and limited in audience scope today.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the use of stereotypes are powerful ways to communicate a message. Never willing to pass up a way to sell a message, thus, Madison Avenue has made itself all the more effective by playing on the same or similar stereotypes as have persisted through the years - - just with a different twist. This is precisely why, for example, the alcoholic Irishman stereotype has managed to survive. Instead of being portrayed as the feckless, drunken rascal who would bring nothing but crime and disorderly conduct to America, the alcoholic Irishman stereotype has now been watered down a wee bit to represent the new carefree, hard drinking, hard-playing man among men who we should all join and emulate at the nearest bar selling Coors Light. Irish Americans are still being cast as drunks, but they are now acceptable and even lovable – so much so, indeed, that we are all urged to be just like them!</p>
<p>The images I selected to post strongly support the idea that, while stereotypes may stay the same through the years in terms of basic substance, they can change dramatically in terms of their uses and intended purposes. One of the nineteenth century cartoons I posted and the modern day cartoon I posted both address the alcoholic Irishman stereotype. That, however, is where the similarity stops. Clearly, one cartoon intends to use the stereotype to the detriment of the Irish, whereas the recent cartoon seeks to convey a much more positive view of an Irishman with drink in hand. The stereotypical Irish alcoholic who was once an unacceptable threat to decent Americans has apparently been transformed into a vital component of the leisure life of modern America, all through the magic of TV commercials.</p>

			<p>Your post is valid, but it seems you were talking cirlces around yourself, sometimes saying the same thing in different ways. Also, when I looked closely at one of the pictures you chose (the African and Irishman on the scales) I noticed that where ever you got the picture from had whited out the original text &#8220;White&#8221; and typed in &#8220;Irish.&#8221; Here is a link to the original picture, just because.</p>

			<p>I agree that today stereotypes are used to market products to certain ethnic groups.  Some people may think that using stereotypes in marketing is unethical, but if it works then so be it.  Most likely a lot of the people that complain about stereotypes also buy products marketed on stereotypes.  Overt racism may not be present in the media anymore in America, however there is definitely still plenty of covert racism is the American media.</p>

			<p>Yes, I agree that &#8220;“cultural work” performed by stereotypes today seems more akin to “marketing support”.&#8221;  It is obvious that certain brands sell more and become successful because they are speaking to a particular audience.  It is natural for us to want to belong to a certain group.  Maybe selling items or clothing geared towards a group will help people to identify themselves.  For example, African American boys tend to dress in baggy clothes, and sport certain brand names.  Wearing these clothes may make them feel like they are identifying themselves to everyone.  In this way, it is understandable that products can sell.</p>
<p>I think your post could have been improved if you included some ways for us to change the way we think about certain races, genders, age groups, backgrounds, etc.  It would have been better if you could tell us some ways for us to prevent stereotyping people.  Overall, I enjoyed reading your post.</p>

			<p>As an Irish person I am used to hearing people say, “You’re Irish, you must be a drinker,” or “I bet you can handle your alcohol.” While being in college it’s not always a bad thing since it seems like a majority of the people saying it are the ones right next to you drinking too, but I can see how it is also an annoying thing to have to put up with. The best thing to do is find ways to stop these stereotypes from happening. Stereotypes can cause unnecessary fear in people that don’t understand things.<br />
I also agree that stereotypes are used to sell products. In the commercial for Bacardi rum and diet cola drinks, the room is full of really skinny men and women wearing very little clothes. The commercial makes it seem as though drinking the drink with “0 carbs 0 calories” will make you skinny like them too.</p>

			<p>I really thought you made some good references to stereotypes.  I liked how you used stereotypes to tell what they were trying to get across and how they are perceived in our society today as Americans. How you say that stereotypes today are used to market things is a good point to be made because it is true that people relate to certain things and it appeals to use to go out and buy something because of how it is presented to us. It was cool that you chose one certain stereotype and how it changed over time. I liked that.</p>
<p>I thought that you could of went into more detail about the ads that you chose to write about. You just gave brief descriptions of them and just a little comment. I know you talked about the idea of them in your paragraph, but talking more about the pictures themselves and what they are showing would of helped more.</p>

			<p>I like how you went about your post as explaining stereotypes overall instead of just picking one or two to talk about. I agree with you about how stereotypes market things. It&#8217;s so obvious in ad&#8217;s what way you will be perceived by wearing or consuming a certain item.</p>
<p>I agree with some of the others that you could go into more detail about your examples and explain why the stereotypes are used in that situation. I also think you could talk about how we can work to change these stereotypes.</p>

			<p>First off you post is very well written. But i felt that sometimes you said the same thing over and over again. You didnt really expand at all on you topic. I liked that you explained the Irish sterotypes, yet you did not touch on anyother Race or Gender. The post was focused on one sole sterotype and the gerneralization of stereotypes. I felt as if  you could have expanded your research alittle and talked about blacks or Spanish americans.</p>

			<p>That was by far the best post I have read so far. You demonstrated some really good points and it made me become indulged tremendously in your article. I thought it was really smart how you picked out one example and just further explained it instead of giving more than one example. The irish men example and how it has changed through out time with the people&#8217;s mentality. I also think that the stereotypes in the 19th century were more aggressive because they were trying everything they can to get a person out of a place like they owned it, but now a days stereotypes are merely stating an opinion and controlling their own life because no individual has the power to change the whole world now. NOT EVEN GEORGE BUSH!</p>

			<p>I thought your post was well written, but your ideas didn&#8217;t get across that well. You chose to give one example which i htought was nice, because you went into details, but that&#8217;s where i think you started to repeat some of the things you were tying to say. One thing I really saw interesting was when you said Stereotypes are used in marketing, which I now agree with. Overall nice post.</p>

			<p>There is little I can comment on this post, because this is an argument I would probably make when discussing the evolution of stereotypes. One way I felt you could have improved your introduction was to say that stereotypes have essentially become less offensive with time. Also I don&#8217;t feel that it would be an overstatement to say that in a society where there is alot of pressure to fit in, many Americans appreciate the stereotypes that label them. A good example of this, although its possible you may not have seen this, is at Target. There is a section in the Mens clothing where they have graphic tees. As St. Patricks day neared, shirts appeared saying things about being Irish and being able to outdrink everyone. These shirts seemed to dissappear as soon as they were put up for sale. Another personal example I have of people appreciating their stereotypes is my boyfriend. He is Irish and claims to have drinking powers handed down from his ancestors at almost any party we go to. His friends whom are Irish are the same way, its like fame to them. I liked this post as it was approached in a different and unexpected manner, by stating stereotypes are used alot in marketing these days because they are less offensive. Great post overall, I had very few objections, and feel this is something close to an argument I would have.</p>

			<p>I found the idea of stereotypes used to &#8220;marginalize&#8221; different cultures interesting. It really speaks to the attitude of Americans during that period of immigration.</p>
<p>I wish you had used more than one example of stereotyping &#8212; the Irishman &#8212; to make your points.  That stereotype particularly seems to have changed at a disproportionate rate to others.</p>

			<p>I found your post to be very interesting. You made some valid points that I agree with whole heartedly.  For example, I agreed when you said that while stereotypes may stay the same through the years in terms of basic substance, they can change dramatically in terms of their uses and intended purposes. That is very valid. Times change along with the way we stereotype people and different groups of people.  I think that you had a very strong post. Well done.</p>

			<p>It’s true about what you said that nowadays stereotypes are used in marketing to specific groups of people.  This tactic that is used to sell items is used obviously because it works and it seems to me that the society will never be able to stop this idea and mentality of thinking, it’s just to established in the minds of people. It’s possible over a long period of time if that certain group of people change their image then people will start thinking about them differently but until that happens things will remain the same. It was interesting to read about how you chose a specific stereotype and how it evolved over a time span.  Your post was overall a good write-up but at times felt a bit redundant.</p>

			<p>I enjoyed reading everything about your post and I was always curious what the next sentence was going to say because everything was really interesting.  I agree with all your points that you made in this post.  For intstance, I agree with you when you said &#8220;the use of stereotypes are powerful ways to communicate a message.&#8221;  I never really looked at it that way but you are right.  Most of the time the message gets ut wrong though.  I loved your thesis stateement.  Its an arguable statement that seemed to be well thought through.  That statement made your paper twice as strong.<br />
The only critisism I have is that you only have one example and that is about the Irish.  Next time just make sure to include more examples.  Excellent job though</p>

			<p>I always think stereotypes today seem more akin to marketing support, because they only looking for certain brand or item that belong to themselves. So that way they can sell more items to those people. Cloth, music and food those are most common things to those people who want to identify themselves. I really like when you said “Irishman who like drink so much, they like to be drunk. Irish Americans are still being cast as drunks.”<br />
Because I don’t know a lot about Irish people. However, in my mind I think Irish love to drink that is one stereotype Irish people can drink a lot. I really like how you example and explain why people use stereotype to sell their products. I think this is very good blog, if you can post some picture about the stereotype what you talk about it, that will make your blog better. So people can see it and make us easy understand you blog. Well done I enjoyed read your blog.</p>

			<p>I liked how you explained sterotypes in our society. The use of Irish soicety linked to drinking is a very good example of a common sterotype people have. In todays world there are many gereraliztions just like 19th century. I agree back then sterotypes were used to outcaste people now it is used to target certain markets of people for promoting purposes. Overall i thought your blog was well written good job.</p>

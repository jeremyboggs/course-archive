			<div class="entry">
				<p>It all started during the American Civil War when the Confederate States of America created several flags to help them define the war.  The first flag designed by the Confederate States was the Confederate flag.   The Confederate battle flag, called the &#8220;Southern Cross&#8221; or the cross of St. Andrew, has been described variously as a “proud emblem of Southern heritage and as a shameful reminder of slavery and segregation.”  The display of this flag throughout the south has brought much controversy primarily because of the disagreements it has created as to what it truly symbolizes.  The people who support the Confederate flag, mainly in the South, state that the flag is a symbol of their heritage and pride in their ancestors who survived years of war under terrible odds and sacrifice.  People who disagree with the Confederate Flag see it as a symbol of slavery, a symbol of rebellion, and even its attempt at trying to enforce racial segregation.  <strong>Ever since the ending of the American Civil War, the Confederate flag has brought much controversy of whether or not it should be acceptable for southern states to raise a flag that many American’s think symbolize racial hatred and white supremacy.    </strong></p>
<p>In this article, <a href="http://www.aestheticrealism.net/aesnyc141/aesthetics-and-life/confederacy_aesthetics.htm">Alice Bernstein</a> states that it is wrong for a confederate flag to be flown over South Carolina’s statehouse building or any other building. She states:</p>
<blockquote><p>If there had not been the desire to maintain slavery, there would have been no Confederacy and no Confederate flag at all. The Confederacy arose from something completely hideous: the feeling in persons that other human beings should be their property&#8230;. The reason the Southern states seceded from the Union in 1861 was to be able to preserve slavery&#8230;. South Carolina might just as well display a bullwhip and auction block at its statehouse, because these and the Confederate flag stand for the same thing. </p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, Bernstein is extremely unhappy with how the Confederate flag started.  If they would have just abolished slavery then the Confederate flag and the controversies that come with the flag would not be in existence.  Most flags arise from the fact that a group of people want to use a symbol to represent what they stand for.  The American flag represents the 50 states and 13 original colonies; the Canadian flag represents the Maple Leaf, a symbol of their county.  The confederate flag represents a very dark period in US history.  It says that it was acceptable to imprison people against their will and treat them so poorly that many of them died. </p>
<p>In this article, <a href="http://www.cynicalbastards.com/cynic/contrib/flag.html">Jessica Kate</a> supports the Confederate Flag in several different scenarios.  She states that the flag is a symbol of the fact that the people live in the south and also is part of the past.  She also states how it symbolizes what black people actually had to go through and what everyone else had to go through during the war including the people who died.  She states:     </p>
<blockquote><p>A good way to look at the Confederate flag is to realize that it shows how far we&#8217;ve come as a society; from having blacks as slaves to giving them freedom. Also, regardless of how painful people today think slavery was, they weren&#8217;t a part of it, so they shouldn&#8217;t have any need to fool with the subject of the confederate flag, unless they&#8217;re just out to piss off a lot of people by not only taking away a part of the tradition of the South (to hang the flag), but also by calling those people racist, when maybe they aren&#8217;t. Not all people that support the flag are racist.</p></blockquote>
<p>What Jessica is trying to say is that there is always more than one aspect to a controversy.  She discusses the many good ways in looking at this flag.  Some good ways include seeing how far we’ve come as a society, giving freedom to blacks, and even stating that they weren’t part of slavery. </p>
<p>I agree with Alice Bernstein stating that it is wrong to have the Confederate flag flown over any buildings in this society.  At one point in time, I might have agreed with its existence because of the remembrance of the revolution and the pride it represents, but it grew into a symbol of hatred and racism perpetuated by the Klu Klux Klan and other bitter southerners.  I am extremely disappointed with the existence of this flag today because it represents a place of slavery, a place of rebellion, and even a place of racial segregation.  The fact that some of us today are still honoring those three things is just preposterous. If the South really was interested in preserving its history, they might consider creating a new flag that would be widely accepted by all races as a true symbol of the past that demonstrates both the pride of the southerners and the strife that African Americans were forced to endure.</p>

			<p>I agree with you and your views on how the Confederate flag should not be a symbol that we use in today&#8217;s society. Though at the same time I understand where Jessica Kate is coming from. It makes sense that the flag is used to show how far we have come as a nation. We can use it as a tool to show the injustice that used to exist and use that as a reference point. In times of hardships we can look at the flag and the world of pain that it caused and remind oursevles that we do not want to return to that point. Though I don&#8217;t think that Kate really address the cost of having the flag. </p>
<p>Your post was good and I enjoyed reading it. You did a good job displaying the two different sides and their views. I was really able to see the opposing viewpoints very clearly. I think that maybe you could have gone into more detail about your interpretation of the writers so readers could understand better. Other than that, good post!</p>

			<p>Wow, I think you just might have found the best speakers for both sides. I agree with Bernstein that it shouldn&#8217;t be hung over state buildings and such, but I also agree with Kate that people just might be taking this issue far more seriously than it needs to be.</p>

			<p>I really liked this post a lot. I agree with you that the flag shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to be flown or allowed to use. I also think that the articles and people you found were very good to and supported both sides very well. I can understand where both sides are coming from and what they think about the flag. So it was interesting to see me agreeing with Jessica Kate and why the flag should be allowed when I think that it shouldn&#8217;t.  But in the end I agree that the flag shouldn&#8217;t be allowed. I think its a point in History that we shouldn&#8217;t want to remember and shouldn&#8217;t want to look at it today as a way to represent that time. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what I would do differently in this post. I really liked this post and I don&#8217;t know if there is a negative I can point out. Maybe you could have talked more about the article and shown more quotes from the articles and then talked more about that. Other then that good post.</p>

			<p>Your post was very well written and the articles you chose provided excellent evidence to support your points.  I totally disagree with the statement that the confederate flag represents a dark period of time in United States history.  The confederate flag was a symbol of the confederacy, however the civil war was not solely about slavery and in fact that was really only one of many important issues.  People just choose to remember the civil war as being about slavery, and unfortunately these people are misinformed.</p>

			<p>Your introduction was very informative to me. I like that you gave some background information about confederate flag, and it makes me understand better about the issue.<br />
I like that you gave quotes from those two articles. That really helped me to understand the ideas of both sides. I also think your interpretation about both editorials is accurate. Those two articles that you chose really support your view. I agreed with Alice Bernstein as you did. I think confederate flag cannot be allowed as long as it could be a symbol of racism. Example of KKK is a excellent evidence to support your own thought about confederate flag. Your post was great and I enjoyed reading it.</p>

			<p>First this blog is very well written.  I agree with your opinion that the flag should not be flown over state buildings.  I am also very impressed that you did not try and make it a legal issue out of whether or not the flag should stay or go.  I think that it is important not to ban the flag from being flown, though it is tempting, we must not forget that free speech applies to everyone, no matter how racist and ignorant they may or may not be.</p>
<p>The only thing I saw a problem with is your suggestion for healing the wounds.  Although it is well intentioned, I think that any flag that represents the confederacy will always cause a stir.  Basically for the reasons stated in your blog by Alice Bernstien.</p>

			<p>A very well written posts that shows examples for both sides of the argument.  There are places where the Confederate flag should not be flown, and since we live in the UNITED States and not the CONFEDERATE States, having the Confederate flag is just for history purposes.  But to suggest that the flag is a symbol for slavery, rebellion, and segregation is wrong.  I understand that this is your opinion, and probably the opinion of others as well, but the Confederate flag is a symbol for a lot more things like freedom and having rights.  Alice Bernstein is also wrong in saying that slavery is the only reason why the Civil War started and the only reason there is a Confederate flag to begin with.  She obviously is not a fan of the flag, but she can&#8217;t just block out everything else that was the cause for the Civil War.</p>

			<p>I think you did a really great job with your post. You used great examples from each side that really give good points for why the oppose or support the confederate flag. I completely agree with you when you write, &#8220;At one point in time, I might have agreed with its existence because of the remembrance of the revolution and the pride it represents, but it grew into a symbol of hatred and racism perpetuated by the Klu Klux Klan and other bitter southerners.&#8221; While I really hate the fact that these sorts of people have taken on the confederate flag as some sort of weapon for hate, I agree that this is why we simply cannot fly it above our states capitals. I believe that it is ridiculous that this continues in 2007.</p>
<p>However, I do disagree with you when you talk about making a new flag for Southerners that wish to fly one. If it is your personal decision to fly, wear, support the confederate flag, I believe that is your choice and should not be taken away. While I have seen people use the flag for hate, I have also seen many use it to show their pride in the state they come from and their ancestors who fought during the war. So I can&#8217;t agree with the idea to totally disreguard the flag because of those who choose to wrongly symbolize it.</p>
<p>Overall I really enjoyed your post and think you did a great job!</p>

			<p>.    Good post! The way that the post author presents this post is by summarizing the facts which people agree and disagree on the confederate flag. Not only did they summarize both sides but, they even give out examples that are from each side. After reading this post, I clearly understand where each side stands. To me, I honestly think that you will have to live during that time where it all took place to pick a side whether you agree or disagree. What I like about this post is that the post author included examples from the articles that they read. I couldn’t really find anything about this post so; I didn’t dislike anything that the post author wrote. I somewhat agree what the post author is trying to say saying that they disagree that the confederate flag shouldn’t be flown on top of buildings. In my point of view, I think that the post author did summarized and critiqued the two editorials by having examples from the editorial on their post. If the post author didn’t include any examples from the editorials, then I wouldn’t think that it was accurate.</p>

			<p>Even though I respect your opinion, I completely disagree. THE CIVIL WAR WAS NOT ABOUT SLAVERY AND/OR RACIAL SEGREGATION. It is about State&#8217;s Rights.  I don&#8217;t expect everyone to understand exactly how us southerners feel, but just let it be. The Confederate flag symbolize our pride. We do not agree with the Klu Klux Klan and other groups that use the flag, because racial segregation and slavery is not what this flag stands for. There is no harm in waving this flag. As proud of the American flag we have, we are proud of the Confederate as well. If we were to make a new flag, it wouldnt be the same, because it is not the same flag. All in all it was a strong post. well done!</p>

			<p>Your opening paragraph is really good. It provided a nice summary of the issue, and your thesis addressed why it was controversial. I don’t know if I could have done a better job. Your evidence was also very clear and to the point, and showed both points of views equally, both with good arguments, before taking a side. Furthermore, I think it was very helpful that you included a portion of the article in your post because the reader is unlikely to read the entire article. This way, you picked out the most important part to read for us. </p>
<p>I agree with you that it might be a good thing to change the flag in a way that honors southern pride without symbolizing suppression. But, you make it seem like if the flag is changed, than people wont honor slavery, rebellion, and racial segregation. I am not a southerner and would never fly the confederate flag, but I feel that people have the right to do so if they want, whether or not it is in a good way or bad way. If the confederate flag is banned, true racists will be stripped of a way to express how they feel and may express themselves through actions, and people with mere southern pride will be pissed off. I think the best way to deal with the problem is to respect that people fly the flag for different reasons and not make any judgments.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m really glad to see two very good opinions for both arguements. The confederate flag is a very important part of southern history. I believe that it represents pride to be a southern and it is for the people who faught for its side. I dont think it is there to represent slavery.</p>

			<p>This post reeks of radical liberalism and is full of non-truths.  To state that the primary reason that the Civil War was fought was slavery is preposterous.  This is another attempt to wipe out a major part of white American culture and history.  Simply banning the flag and burying ones head in the sand wont make the flag and the good and bad that goes along with it go away.  In the end this is another issue blown way out of proportion by race baiters. I fully feel that it is a persons own individual choice to display a confederate flag and simply banning it would not change anything. It is a symbol of southern heritage and pride for fighting for what they believed in. Everyone feels differently about things. People can display a confederate flag for many reasons other than racism. Perhaps someones relative fought in the war and they want to remeber them and be proud for what they did.<br />
Your post was intriguing and thoughtful. You did a good job showing both sides of the argument. I do not feel that your thesis was proved with your arguments though. In your thesis you talked about states right to fly the flag but the people you chose to defend your thesis just spoke based on opinion.</p>

			<p>Overall I felt that this was a strong post. Both people you used as references presented strong arguments for their feelings. Also you took a stand by agreeing with one of the opposing arguments, creating a more interesting post. </p>
<p>One major issue I had with this post is your interpretation of the symbolism of the flag. It is true that some southerners might consider the flag, I know a few myself. However, you must consider those southerners that lost family in the war, granted none are alive today, this is another reason why the flag is around. The southerners didn&#8217;t just rebel, they fought for something they believed in, we were all wrong with the creation and maintaining slavery, the south just wasn&#8217;t ready to give it up yet. Today the southern populations don&#8217;t want slavery any more than you and I, but in the same respect they would like to reserve their part of history.</p>

			<p>Your two articles both make very compelling arguments for their side of this controversy. However I feel it is necessary to keep in mind the fact that the confederate flag symbolizes more then just slavery and hatred. The confederate flag is symbolic of a major era of U.S. history. The confederate flag is used to symbolize the southern pride that they are renowned for. There is always multiple sides to every symbol, but people always seem to forget the positive ones and focus primarily on the negative ones.</p>
<p>Your paper is organized a little awkwardly, but overall it&#8217;s still a solid post.</p>

			<p>I think your post was good and strong. Even though the confederate flag stands for other than slavery and hatred that doesn&#8217;t mean its okay to display it, because that still means that the person who displays it is going along with all the ideas it stands for.</p>

			<p>your post was good with the structure and the amount of content which was in it.  It does bring up a huge question on weather to keep the flag or discard it.  I think we should keep it because it does remind us of our past and even though it might be offensive to some but to the others it might represent some history within the flag so we should keep it and if you don&#8217;t like it then just disregard it and continue with life.</p>

<p>In this article, <a href="http://www.cynicalbastards.com/cynic/contrib/flag.html">Jessica Kate</a> supports the Confederate Flag in several different scenarios.  She states that the flag is a symbol of the fact that the people live in the south and also is part of the past.  She also states how it symbolizes what black people actually had to go through and what everyone else had to go through during the war including the people who died.  She states:                     </p>
<p>             A good way to look at the Confederate flag is to realize that it shows how far we&#8217;ve come as a society; from having blacks as slaves</p>
<p>             to giving them freedom.  Also, regardless of how painful people today think slavery was, they weren&#8217;t a part of it, so they shouldn&#8217;t  </p>
<p>             have any need to fool with the subject of the  confederate flag, unless they&#8217;re just out to piss off a lot of people by not only taking</p>
<p>             away a part of the tradition of the South (to hang the flag), but also by  calling those people racist, when maybe they aren&#8217;t. Not all </p>
<p>             people that support the flag are racist. </p>
<p>What Jessica is trying to say is that there is always more than one aspect to a controversy.  She discusses the many good ways in looking at this flag.  Some good ways include seeing how far we’ve come as a society, giving freedom to blacks, and even stating that they weren’t part of slavery. </p>
<p>I agree with Alice Bernstein stating that it is wrong to have the Confederate flag flown over any buildings in this society.  At one point in time, I might have agreed with its existence because of the remembrance of the revolution and the pride it represents, but it grew into a symbol of hatred and racism perpetuated by the Klu Klux Klan and other bitter southerners.  I am extremely disappointed with the existence of this flag today because it represents a place of slavery, a place of rebellion, and even a place of racial segregation.  The fact that some of us today are still honoring those three things is just preposterous. If the South really was interested in preserving its history, they might consider creating a new flag that would be widely accepted by all races as a true symbol of the past that demonstrates both the pride of the southerners and the strife that African Americans were forced to endure.</p>

			<p>You address your topic and thesis thoroughly.  I like your evidence/quote from the two comparisons.  You made some good points and strong arguments.  Your post was also very detailed and well organized.  The Confederate flag did bring a lot of controversy and still does today.  Your paper was descriptive and overal well-written.</p>
<p>The structure of your paper did not follow what was assigned in the syllabus.  Your paper seemed too long to fit the word critera.  It would have been better if your blog just included more of your MAJOR points because you had some information that wasn&#8217;t necessary.  The format of the paper was wrong, but overall I enjoyed reading your post.</p>

			<p>The confederate flag means many different things to people all across the United States. The people who advocate the flag as a symbol of history are choosing to be dissenters on purpose. There are thousands of symbols people from the south could use as references to their past. By choosing the confederate flag as the ONLY symbol that show their past, I believe they are choosing to acknowledge a racist and suppressive period in the USA. The confederate flag stood for many things, but one prominent one was the southern way of life. As we, all know slavery is an indistinguishable part of the south during that period. The flag only perpetuate those types of thoughts and problems in the USA today. </p>
<p>I think that you did a good job with your post. Your grammar and word choice were good. I think the one area of your post that you could added a little more detail to both of the articles you discussed.</p>

			<p>Your post was very well written, and I like how you gave two opposite views. I dont agree with Jessica Kate either, although I am not at all saying that all southern people are racist, because i&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re not and it would just be wrong to generalize like that but if they saw how much it hurts and makes people uncomfortable and causes this much hatred and arguments, they should just easily pick to get rid of it but they dont.</p>

			<p>To ban the conderate flag or not is not a easy question to ask. There are people who follow it for the right reasons and for wrong reasons. Sometimes its not easy to distigish the difference. It important to see that this country is built on morals that say allow poeple to beleive in or follow what ever religion. However i don&#8217;t know what is said about pledging to a differnt flag. Could that be considered unpatriotic. I don&#8217;t konw what to say about this however you make very good points. Good jot on the post.</p>

			<p>I think you argued your point well, and I especially liked your suggestion of creating a new flag that would not offend certain people or hold negative connotations. The flag certainly should not fly over the South Carolina courthouse, since it would look like the government was condoning everything that the flag symbolizes, both the good and bad. I also liked how you chose a post arguing for the flag that didn&#8217;t seem defensive or overtly racist.</p>

			<p>Good post, as I&#8217;ve stated in previous comments this topic has good arguments on both sides, and you provided two great examples of uniqueness of this controversy. I am definitley in favor of banning the flag outside the S.C. courthouse, however I feel like individuals should be able to express themselves and if they want to wear the flag or have it outside their house.</p>

				<p>&#8220;Glory&#8221; directed by Edward Zwick captures the reality of the Civil War with an amazing cast including Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, and Morgan Freeman. Glory is about the 54th Massachusetts regiment which was the first all black regiment to serve in the Civil War. Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) led the regiment and had the challenging task of preparing these untrained voluntary soldiers for war. Shaw also had to put up with criticism from other ranking officials and the impartial attitudes towards the 54th regiment. The 54th regiment was treated unfairly by receiving lower wages and not receiving proper supplies. However, Colonel Shaw and his other ranking officials made a huge statement when they too ripped up their paychecks after the black soldiers did so in defiance of being paid less than white soldiers. The black soldiers argued that we die just like anyone else, and when the officers decided to rip their checks they got respect and loyalty from their soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>The movie&#8217;s overall message is about the hardships that black soldiers faced in fighting in the Civil War, and the impact that black people had on the Civil War</strong>. The black people fighting for the &#8220;54&#8243; wanted to be treated as equal human beings and went to great lengths to prove it by dying for that right. The &#8220;54&#8243; also wanted to prove that they were in fact not only capable of fighting in a war but could do it just as well if not better than any other regiment. It showed the courage of black people in a time when slavery was still present. The 54th regiment had no respect from other soldiers at the beginning and really had to earn their respect by fighting and dying for their country like the rest of the soldiers. By the end of the movie it was clear that the 54th regiment was a strong infantry and respect was rightfully given to them. One scene in particular that exemplified this was when one of the soldiers from another unit who had previously degraded the &#8220;54&#8243; stood as the &#8220;54&#8243; passed preparing to attack a Confederate Fort in Charleston, S.C. and yelled &#8220;Give em hell 54&#8243; in a way that said we respect you (one of my favorite parts). Everyone knew the daunting task of attacking the Fort yet no one in the &#8220;54&#8243; showed any signs of fear. This movie is a great use of history in teaching people the impact that black people actually had on the Civil War, and surprisingly many people didn&#8217;t realize that black people fought and died in this war, and in every war that America has fought for our freedoms.</p>
<p>The movie was designed to be very dramatic and powerful so it&#8217;s easy to see that some of the scenes were exaggerated a little bit to increase the drama of the movie. For instance, it was stated that the black units never had to go months without proper boots and uniforms. I also question whether or not they were paid unequally in comparison to white union soldiers, although I could believe this to be true. In this period of time blacks in the union, although freed slaves were still treated unequally in comparison to white soldiers which was accurately stated in the movie. I wondered how the other all-white regiments actually felt about having a black regiment fighting on their side, it seems to me that they would be grateful for the help and very appreciative, but in the beginning of the movie this was not the case and most people took the &#8220;54&#8243; as a joke that would never actually engage in real battles.</p>
<p>The musical background of the movie done by composer James Horner is absolutely beautiful. The musical theme is played throughout the movie and had such an emotional impact on me when watching it. The music is just as powerful as the screenplay and is definitely a key ingredient in making Glory so profound. This in my mind is one of the most poignant musical themes in any movie I&#8217;ve ever seen</p>

				<p>The American Civil War was one of the most significant events that have happened in American history. Many films have been made to portray the Civil War battles and lifestyles. However, the movie that sticks in my head on the topic of the Civil War is <u>Glory</u>. This movie is a very historical movie that depicts the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Regiment during the American Civil War. <strong><u>Glory</u> shows the unfair treatment of African Americans in the </strong><strong>U.S.</strong><strong> Army while fighting in the Civil War through the depiction of Col</strong><strong>. Robert Gould Shaw’s 54<sup>th</sup> regiment<strong>.</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>            </strong><strong>This movie shows us how the U.S. Army during the Civil War unfairly treated the African American soldiers and their struggle against their mistreatment. The film focuses on one of the first formal all African American units, the 54<sup>th</sup> Massachusetts Volunteer Regiment. The first evident injustice to the African American soldiers was that they were all placed in the same unit. During the Civil War the units that did allow African Americans had to be segregated from the white units. This made these soldiers feel as though they were not part of the “team” for example and looked down upon. Moreover, these African American units had to be commanded by all white officers. These officers were mostly abolitionists and did not mistreat the soldiers; however, the fact that these soldiers could not command themselves and needed a white officer to command them. This is a very historical fact that did happen at this time. Even though the fight for abolition was one of the main causes of the war and the African Americans wanted to join the fight having considerable motivation, they were not all allowed to serve and only a few African American units were created. Most of the African Americans in the units were depicted as runaway slaves from the South; however this was not the case. The majority of the soldiers were born free in the North. This is one fact that was misrepresented in the film. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>            This film really portrays the effort set forth by the African American soldiers during the American Civil War despite the unreasonable circumstances the U.S. Army put the soldiers through. In one scene of the movie the colored soldiers refuse pay for their duties simply because it was unequal of those that were white. This unequal treatment caused a great discouraging effect but shows their persistence when they want to fight so desperately for their country despite this injustice.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>            In all the movie had some historical imperfections but was mostly historical accurate. The African American units were never really given a chance to prove themselves in battle. These units were looked down upon the white units because they felt that they were better trained and that the colored units were simply incapable of leading a major attack. In the end, the 54<sup>th</sup> </strong><strong>Massachusetts</strong><strong> gets to prove themselves in battle fighting together with their white comrades in the attack of </strong><strong>Fort</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Wagner</strong><strong>.  In the last scenes of the film the 54<sup>th</sup> leads the famous attack on the south at </strong><strong>Fort</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Wagner</strong><strong>. The regiment loses about half of their men in the fight. Yet records show that the regiment only suffered about one-fifth to fatalities. The attack was the first to be led by an African American unit and proved to the U.S. Army that they were capable of being men and fighting remarkably. Many of the African American soldiers that survived received the Medal of Honor for their notable attack on </strong><strong>Fort</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Wagner</strong><strong>. In the last part of the film Col. Shaw was seen being shot and killed right after commanding his troops to move forward against the Confederates, which was based on actual accounts of this battle.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>In the final scene the colonel gets buried with the rest of his troops, which is also accurately depicted. This portrayal was meant, at the time of the war, to be an insult but shows the unity within the unit that existed due to the unfair treatment of the African American units by the U.S. Army. This movie truly illustrates the many different conflicts of prejudice within the U.S. Army that continued throughout the Civil War conflict. <u>Glory</u> was one of the best historical films because it takes a topic rarely discussed when discussing the American Civil War and shows how the war was really like in the eyes of an African American soldier in the U.S. Army. This movie is a must see for any true historian.</strong></p>

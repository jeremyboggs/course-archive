			<div class="entry">
				<p>As we have seen in class, purely historical representations of events can be boring and unemotional while highly dramatized representations can be overly biased and smudge the truth. <strong>Tora! Tora! Tora! Is a film that proves historical representation can be engaging and eye-opening, while Pearl Harbor is a perfect example of dramatized bias.</strong><br />
Tora!Tora!Tora!(Tora) Was released in 1970 and was nominated for five academy awards, winning in the Best Effects category. This film is unique, because it is essentially two sets of the same story. One English and one Japanese using a different film crew for each. In using two different film crews this film provides a very balanced, and unbiased view of the Pearl Harbor attack and the events that led to it. The intended audience for this film was the American public, in order to educate them about the complexities of what happened regarding the Pearl Harbor attack. This is shown through the various segments in which the Americans are shown overlooking something, and also in the Japanese scenes, showing the internal power struggles within their regime.<br />
Pearl Harbor was released in 2001 and was nominated for four academy awards, winning the Sound Editing category. This film is an intentionally biased account of the events before, during, and after the Pearl Harbor attack. The purpose of this film is for entertainment and to promote a sense of patriotism through the dramatic story of four characters. The intended audience of this film is the stereotypical American moviegoer. This is shown through numerous extraneous fighting sequences which have nothing to do with the Pearl Harbor attack, and also through the complicated love triangle romance which is the main focus of the movie.<br />
There are many stark differences between the interpretation expressed by each film. One such difference was the way in which the United States military was portrayed. In Pearl Harbor, the military was pictured as very intense, and coordinated. On the day of the attack it pictured everyone at their stations in Washington D.C. as ready and intense as ever, when in fact it was on a Sunday, and most of the personnel was off of work at the time. Tora, on the other hand, portrays the military in a much more realistic, human way. The split is shown between the different divisions of the military and is exemplified by the Air Force not being on the list to receive secret information. Tora also shows the concerns of some of the officers about precautions which could have been taken that were just brushed off. For instance, one soldier remarks that putting all of the planes in the center of the field would make an air attack crippling to the fleet. Tora more importantly shows that the United States had many chances to prepare to defend from the Japanese that were just shirked off. For instance, the radar of the planes flying in which were just thought to be American B-17&#8217;s.<br />
An interesting point to be made about Tora is the fact that neither the President of the United States or the Emperor of Japan are shown at all. This shows the true nature of power in the time of World War II, with the president and emperor  not being much more than figureheads. Also in Tora, the president is shown to be taken off of the secret intelligence list temporarily. If the president was a more prominent power, it would be certain that he would be shown in that movie. In Pearl Harbor however, the president is shown numerous times at poignant moments in order to instill a sort of patriotism in the audience, because F.D.R. is a much respected character whom the audience would be familiar with.<br />
Another major difference between the two movies is where they draw the drama from. In Pearl Harbor, four fictional characters are used as personal connections with the audiences, and most of the movie focuses on their stories. The two pilots are characterized as “good ol’ American boys”, the nurse is a strong female character, and the chef on the ship is a proud tough fighter. In addition, three of these characters fall into a love triangle which further dramatizes the film. These characters are used in order for the audience to connect with the movie on a personal level, and to instill further patriotism by showing them in such a positive light. The way Tora accomplishes its drama is usually the pitfall of historical movies making them boring. Tora uses the actual real people who were involved in the incident, and uses their stories to drive the drama of the plot. This is on both the American and Japanese sides. Instead of being boring, this movie uses the real characters to show the implicit complexities surrounding the event. It showed that on both sides there were problems with power balance within their military systems.<br />
One major bias that occurs in Pearl Harbor is that the Japanese are shown as cruel and evil. The first major instance of this is that one of the head of commands of the Japanese forces looks at children playing, and in spite of this is unaffected and says that the Japanese must secretly attack Pearl Harbor. In Tora it is shown though, that the decision to do so came over a very long period of time with much dissent among even the head of the navy. The Emperor also did not want war, but the “hotheads” in the army still pushed their way and got the attack to happen. Pearl Harbor also does not show the Japanese doing anything human. It just shows the Japanese talking about the attack or the Japanese stoically attacking Pearl Harbor. In Tora though, it shows in great detail the human qualities that the Japanese possessed. In Pearl Harbor it shows the Japanese not sending out a second wave of attackers, because of purely cold, logistical reasons, while in Tora it is shown that withdrawing was very much out of mercy.<br />
When looking critically at both movies, Tora!Tora!Tora! Has about 2 hours worth of historical fact while Pearl Harbor has only about twenty and is treated solely as backing material for the main love story. Also, one of the first scenes in Pearl Harbor is supposed to take place on Long Island and there are mountains shown in the background. This discredits the movie from the start, because there are no mountains in Long Island.<br />
If one is looking for a factually based historical movie, but with an engaging, eye-opening aura around it, Tora!Tora!Tora!, should be the movie for you. If you are looking though, for a patriotic romance, with extraneous action built in, then Pearl Harbor is the way to go.</p>

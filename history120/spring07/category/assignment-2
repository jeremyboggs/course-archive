					<p><strong>While looking at the module depicting an image of the Boston Massacre, it is clear to see the bias shown against the British, and that the physical state of the British and Americans were very different.</strong> The module paints a clear picture for us to visualize the Boston Massacre itself, with such details as where people standing and what it is they are doing. You can see that Captain Preston, the British commander, is standing behind all of his men cheering them on, but not actually fighting himself, or standing in the line of danger. His troops are in a line infront of him all firing their guns at the Americans. The crowd itself is not nearly as organized as the British troops are, in both appearance and actions. They appear to be unarmed, nor are they fighting back, but tending to ones already shot by the British troops. It seems to be early evening, as you can see a small cresent moon in the upper left-hand corner.</p>
<p>One problem with the history of certain events, is that they most often are told from a specific view point, and are therefore biased in some way, shape, or form. By looking at this particular module, it seems Revere wants his viewers to interpret the Boston Massacre as the British making a surprise attack on unarmed Americans, and blatantly making the British out to be the bad guys. With that being said, Revere has also made the American&#8217;s appear disorganized by depicting them as a giant mob of people, instead of the organized line the British are standing in. To take it one step further, one could say that this particular group of American&#8217;s in Boston are not very patriotic because they do not appear to be actively fighting for their independence from Britain. Because Revere has created this picture, he obviously had a specific story he wanted to tell. Depending on wether it was a British or an American, others may tell the story a completely different way. </p>
<p>Although this module does tell a particular story from a particular point of view, that doesn&#8217;t mean that it is not credible. It is simply a portrayal of a part of history, which could very well be accurate. With so many different things going on in the picture, there are many ways to interpret what Revere is trying to depict, some being more obvious than others.</p>

<p><strong>The use of images can be helpful in understanding history because it gives you an actual look at what happened during the event that is being depicted, however you must be careful with images because they may be a biased look at the event.</strong> The <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/exploring/18thcentury/bostonmassacre/assignment.php">picture</a> by Paul Revere showing the Boston Massacre shows the side of the American people involved in the incident. Before describing what the picture shows, we must understand what actually happened in the Boston Massacre. A barbers apprentice was yelling at a British soldier because he thought that the soldier had not paid his bill. The soldier had in fact paid it but paid no attention to the boy. The boy continued to yell at the soldier so the soldier clubbed him. This act wound up creating a large mob of angry Americans who through things at the soldiers. The soldiers then called in for reinforcements. A chunk of ice hit one of the soldiers and knocked him on the ground and he fired into the air as he fell. Apparently, someone had yelled &#8220;fire.&#8221; This led to the rest of the troops firing into the crowd (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_massacre">wikipedia</a>). In the picture, Captian Preston is behind a line of troops with his sword raised ordering them to fire into the crowd of Americans. It seems to be depicting a hateful and uncalled for act by the Captian. In reality, one of the soldiers that was trying to keep the mob at bay. The troops are shown right next to the mob of Americans viciously gunning them down. There are huge clouds of smoke in the picture due to all the gunfire. The American crowd is larger than that of the British soldiers and is shown as completely innocent and scared. They seem to be cowering, trying to help the injured, and three dead mean on the ground.</p>
<p>This picture is being used to show the Americans being completely massacred, hence the name of the event, for no apparent reason. Revere must have wanted this picture to horrify Americans because he made some changes in the picture. First of all, he changed the name of the building behind the soldiers from Customs House to Butcher&#8217;s Hall. This makes the British seem like they are killing the Americans for no good reason. Secondly, the Americans are no retaliating what so ever and look completely innocent. Now nothing that I read says the Americans retaliated when the British started shooting, but they definitely were not being peaceful prior to the shots being fired. It seems Revere just wanted Americans to see this event as an innocent group of Americans were just walking around town and then some soldiers came and shot at them for no good reason. The British may not have been just in their actions, but it was not them just shooting Americans for no reason.</p>

					<p><strong>Images can be very useful for historians to determine one side&#8217;s feelings towards an event in history.</strong> For example, <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/exploring/18thcentury/bostonmassacre/assignment.php">this picture</a>, by Paul Revere, of the Boston Massacre portrays the American&#8217;s view of what happened there. The British commander is standing behind his troops giving them the orders almost as if he is unwilling to do any of the dirty work himself. The British troops are in front of a building with a sign that reads &#8220;Butchers House&#8221; on it suggesting that they are &#8220;butchering&#8221; the Americans. The American&#8217;s in this picture out number the British about 2-1. However the Americans are not fighting back against the British. Also the fight is happening in the middle of a street, in front of a church, at night. This helps to portray the British as evil since its in front of a church, and at night.</p>
<p>Paul Revere uses this picture to depict the British as evil, and probably to help gain support from the colonists for the revolution. The British are firing on people that are completely defenseless, that show no signs of instigation, and who are not fighting back. Revere even changes the name of the building they are in front of from custom house to Butchers house. The leader of the British troops is standing there calling out orders to his men, encouraging them to continue to add to the violence. All of this adds to the idea that Revere wanted this to appear as brutal, and as uncalled for as possible. Pictures such as this suggest that revolutionary leaders were very creative in their attempts to gain support for their cause. It also serves to illustrate one potential view of this event. The reason that there may be several different accounts of an event like this is because people tend to exaggerate stories to make actions resulting from it seem more justified. Phenomena like this can help historians to begin to realize how stories can spread and create more support for actions, and how historical events can be altered to show one side more negatively then the other.</p>

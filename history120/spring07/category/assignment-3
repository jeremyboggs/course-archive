					<p><strong>	The Jacksonian era was a time of major upheaval, from the lives of ordinary citizens to the government and its policies, so a utopian society would have to account for these changes</strong>.  Politically, the Nullification Crisis caused quite a ripple as the power of States to disagree with the Federal Government came into question.  Socially, temperance and suffrage were in vogue.  In terms of religion, the Jacksonian era came on the heels of the Second Great Awakening.  Economically, the North and South were split into Industrial and Agricultural production respectively; also Jackson&#8217;s move to take power away from the Federal Bank resulted in some inflation and distrust of citizens in paper money.  Culturally, The role of the individual was stressed and given agency, as opposed to the days where only those of wealth and property would have a voice.  The utopian community I put forth takes the above into account. A few key assumptions/purposeful decisions about the community are: that the community is intended to exist in South Carolina and be representative of their views.</p>
<p>The community is governed by a council elected by the people (giving the common man more power), and a chairman to preside is elected by the council from their number.  Their responsibilities pick up where Federal, State and local governing bodies left off. First, they oversee the economic wellbeing of the community.  The council takes on leadership more in a business sense than a political one.  The council is also responsible for proposing laws, though the decision to enact them would be by vote of the community.  The laws&#8217; general purpose in the community is as counterparts to the religious aspect, to prevent radicalism or abuse of the community and its ideals.  The inhabitants&#8217; vote in State or Federal elections is a matter of acting in the interest of the community, so a liaison from the council would be responsible for representing them to the State legislature (and thus betting against the Federal government in a power struggle).</p>
<p>Looking to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64813312@N00/407226455/">map of the community</a> reveals the redress of many of the problems and issues of the Jacksonian era.  The center of the community is the church (citing the recent revival), which serves as a social hub to cement the relationships of those in the community.  The same building would also host the governing body.  Presumably, at least some of the land used for the construction of the utopia would be in use as farmland.  This would remain, and be run as a business by the community council.  A few factories would be constructed as a “hedge bet” against an uncertain financial future (citing the recent tariff fiasco).  The government would run both institutions: hiring employees, building more factories if that proves to be the more profitable route and keeping with the times progressively.  As paper money was trusted less (citing the fallout of Jackson&#8217;s attack on the Bank), employees would be offered a part of their salary in goods at a government owned store where the markup would be a certain percentage set by law to create one source of revenue for the government. The businesses would be jointly owned by all the citizens.  There is no place within the community where one might purchase drink (citing the temperance movement).  The factories and farms are placed in proximity to prevent a rift from forming between the employees of each, and they are placed so that there is room for growth.  As much as possible, the utopia would be self-sufficient.</p>

<p>       My utopia Freedomtown will enjoy the right to practice whatever religious beliefs they want, so long as their religion abides by our peaceful laws, which strictly prohibit violence, stealing, and any other wrongful acts committed against our people. Citizens who are agnostic or atheist are also welcome in our community too. Citizens who are not respectful of other people’s various religious beliefs will be reprimanded and asked to leave our community if the problem persists.</p>
<p>          Our community is set up in a way that encourages individuality and respects the differences of everyone. These differences in ideas and beliefs should be respected by all, and everyone should learn to get along with everyone. Everyone in our town will be regarded as equal, regardless of race, religion, and gender. We would also like to be known as the community with the lowest crime rate. <strong>The ultimate goal of Freedomtown is too create a community with a variety of different people with various religious philosophies to all live peacefully together.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>         Due to our community’s vast differences in beliefs our community realizes the challenges of our town being considered a utopia. However, once people understand the way of life of Freedomtown they will see that it is achievable. Our community encourages the idea of expressing yourself and ideas openly. No religion is seen as right or wrong in the eyes of the community. All townspeople will learn to respect the differences of religious beliefs and opinions, and if certain people cannot abide by this than they will be forced to leave our community. </p>
<p>         Freedomtown will be a mix of urban and rural communities. Our town has its industrial factories located across the river separated from our farms, houses, and public buildings. We have a couple of parks and one big one that will be the social gathering spot for our various events. Our community will be a capitalist economy, which will allow people to own businesses and create revenues as long as it is done peacefully without exploiting people. Our businesses will be allowed to import and export goods to and from other communities. Freedomtown will be a mix of agricultural and industrial businesses, and taxes will be administered in order to pay our public officials and to improve our community as necessary. Social events will be held in the parks every weekend, which will allow the town to get together and socialize around music, beer, and dancing. Everyone is expected to go, but the choice belongs to the residents of our community.  </p>
<p>         Our community will have no one leader in charge instead it will be a leader-by-committee, which will consist of 12 people. The 12 people will be voted in by the people and remain on the board for no longer than 7 years. The rules of Freedomtown are strictly enforced by our town police department. Our town will also have judges that will listen to cases involving residents who have broken laws. The judges will have absolute power and have the ultimate deciding factor of whether or not it is necessary to ban the resident for his act. If a person has been declared banned from the community, he or she has the chance to appeal to a panel of 3 judges. If two out of the three Judges rule in favor of banning the resident than that person must leave Freedomtown within 3 days. A person who is banned may be allowed to come back to the community after 5 years but must have a majority vote approved by the 12 leaders of the community.</p>

					<p><strong>In my <a title="utopia" href="http://flickr.com/photos/56425041@N00/404382099/">utopia</a>, I plan to provide everything for the people living there, with the option to expand; there will never be involuntary unemployment, the crime rate will be minimal, and the residents will generally be in the same socioeconomic class.</strong></p>
<p>The houses in Amical are all in one general area, so that the residents will be able to get to know each other  and be able to help each other out easily.  The houses are, however, spaced out just enough so that the families will be able get their privacy and not have to worry about the neighbors looking through their windows and stuff like that.  The same holds true with the factories and public buildings; they are all grouped together with others like it.  Where people live, work, and hang out are all in separate areas.  While at work, the workers won&#8217;t be able to look out the window and see the shops and start day dreaming.  In order for factory made goods to be readily available all the time, the productivity rate must be excellent.  So that is why the factories are pretty far away from the shops.  But if factory work isn&#8217;t for you, then there will always be jobs available at the shops.  The park is also nearby the shops so that you can get some quiet time in while running errands or if you just need to get away from everyday life.</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome, and we don&#8217;t discriminate.  Every house comes with the means to support the family living there: fields, orchards, woods, and easy access to the river.  I plan to end unemployment in the community by offering work to both men and women at the factory to the people working there.  If the factories were to become crowded, there is plenty of nearby land to build another one.  Any disturbances or breaking of the laws will be solved by the police department, which works with the judicial system.  Depending on who moves into the town, religion may or may not be a major component of our society.  The majority of the residents will also choose which religion to practice at the church.  We will have a governor, who is elected by the people, who will be in charge of the town.  The governor would also have a board of supervisors under him who will keep him in check while making decisions and passing laws.  We want a set up like that so our governor does not receive too much power, or aspire to gain total control.  The wealth will be distributed pretty evenly, since everyone has everything they need to live, and an equal chance of work at the factory.  Although the life style is not lavish, people will live contently and will never have to go without everyday necessities and comforts.  For instance, our people will never miss a meal because they either don&#8217;t have the means to make one or cannot afford one.  Drinking will also be strictly prohibited, which will be strongly enforced by the police department.  Hopefully, this will help increase morale and production rate, while lowering the crime rate.</p>
<p>My goal for this community will be to establish  an effective town in which people will have the freedom to provide for themselves, or choose to pay for the things that they need.  Alcoholism will not be a problem, so there would be no reason for alcohol to provide unproductive behavior.  Women&#8217;s rights will be honored with their equal opportunity to employment, if they choose to work.  I plan for Amical to be the ideal place to live, where everyone could live contently.</p>

					<p><strong>From 1828-1850, the Jacksonian Era defined the lifestyle in the United States, where unprecedented ventures and reform paved the way for the nation to transition from its current rural mentality into a more capitalistic, industrial, and urbanized way of life.</strong></p>
<p>A utopia would consist of both a religious and socialist community. Religious in the sense that since people were becoming more religious, and not drinking and restricting sexual behavior, and Socialist in the sense that people were moving more towards industrialism and making money and economically succeeding. My utopia will be a commercial enterprise, because our main goal is to make alot of money to improve the standards of living and be better than everyone else. Yet, everyone does their share of equal work. The community supports itself by the majority of it being industrial, but there are still some agricultural, because the entire society has not transformed into industrial yet. Some are still holding on to their traditional agricultural roots and since we want the world to be perfect for each one of our citizens, we understand that about them. Our utopia will also be open to the rest of the world, because our main goal is business and richness so the more people there are that come into our world, the more money we will be makng. It will be urban in character yet there will be no slavery. It will be a little bit of both worlds because we are in transition period when people are going from rural to urban, so our main goal is to satisfy both sides.</p>
<p>Our utopia is also a profit seeking capitalist community that also holds religion in high regards. Our religious faith was has not been forgotten even though money has become our number one priority. For our religious rules; there are restrictions on sexual behavior and drinking, and this will be implemented by everyone. It is a close-knit community and everyone keeps an eye on everyone. All people work equally and have equal and set standards. In essence, everyone will work for their fair share and accumulate all their money in one place and distrubute it evenly amongst everyone.</p>
<p>A Board of Directors is technically the head of the town. They don’t rule over anyone but they meet once a week to hear and set any problems straight. They are who the town people go to incase of emergencies, they know everything that is happening. All members of the community meet once a week in any public building and work together or talk. The way it is set out on the map is, the farms and the people that still farm are set on one side of the river. They don’t think the same way the people who have moved to an industrial way of living think and live their life the way they want to but still would rather be in our utopia. They have their farms and their homes. On the other side of the river is the new “city life” way of living. The factories are set all over the place and homes are all around so that people could live close to where they work. There are parks for families to enjoy their time and publc buildings for the citizens of our utopia to have their needs met just incase they are not.</p>

					<p>We hold these truths…<br />
We hold that a moral revival in these United States is possible without Puritanism; that is, without busybodies meddling into our personal affairs, without thought police controlling our intellectual life. We can attain a recommitment to moral values – without puritanical excesses…<br />
We hold that law and order can be restored without turning this country of the free into a police state, as long as we grant public authorities some carefully crafted and circumscribed new powers…<br />
We hold that the family – without which no society has ever survived, let alone flourished – can be saved, without forcing women to stay at home or otherwise violating their rights…<br />
We hold that schools can provide essential moral education – without indoctrinating young people…<br />
We hold that people can live in communities without turning to vigilantes or becoming hostile to one another…<br />
We hold that the pursuit of self-interest can be balanced by a commitment to the community, without requiring us to lead a life of austerity, altruism, or self-sacrifice….<br />
We hold that political officials can be civil and productive, while having different opinions, and still pursue the best interest of the entire community…<br />
We hold that powerful special-interest groups in the nation’s capital, and in so many statehouses and city halls, can be curbed without limiting the constitutional right of the people to lobby and petition those who govern….<br />
We hold these truths as affinitians, as people committed to creating a new moral, social, and public order based on restored communities, without Puritanism or oppression.<br />
The Jacksonian Era was a very influential time in the history of the United States. Expanded suffrage, manifest destiny, and patronage are just a few of the key changes in the nation. However, the political landscape continued to follow the same path of partisanship. <strong>Party politics and sectionalism were the predominant problems of the era.</strong> My utopian society, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/67904202@N00/396864140/">Affinity</a>, is structured to correct the problems associated with the individualistic nature of the previous era.<br />
Since the formation of the Unites States, the resistance between political groups can be identified in each era. Jacksonian democracy was resisted by the Whig party. A major problem during Andrew Jackson’s presidency was the Nullification Crisis. It arose because of sectional differences concerning the Tariff of 1828. “Every state had numerous political factions, but they did not cross state lines.” The United States has consistently faced problems, because different factions try to pursue their own agenda, in the name of nation at large. If every citizen had more of a community-oriented mindset, it would eliminate many of the conflicts associated with individualism.<br />
The edict written above is the cornerstone of my utopian society, Affinity. A nation grounded in these principles has an opportunity to achieve a better sense of unity and community values. Given that the constitution of the Unites States was written in 1787, dilemmas arise because it is relevant for modern times. In Affinity, the edict is shaped for the present era, but is updated by new generations to represent the entire community’s values. Since the members of Affinity share the same core beliefs, this task will not be difficult. Despite being community oriented, individualism is highly encouraged. Having community values while promoting individualism seems like a paradox, however if citizens have their own ambitions and desires while adhering to what is best for the community, it is possible. Having an entire community believe the same core values may seem impractical, but it is how most nations are. The United States does not demand that all the citizens believe in the same basic values, but still most citizens share the same common beliefs: the Bill of Rights lays out most of the beliefs. Affinity will endeavor to do the same.<br />
Geographically, Affinity is designed around a square with Public Buildings in the middle, and Housing and Farming on the outside. Each member of the community has separate plots of land, equally spaced apart. There is farming land, for people to grow crops, and there are factories for other people to work at. The community is primarily capitalist based, but individuals are allowed, based on the edict of the community, to follow more traditional subsistence based living methods. Every citizen has the possibility of achieving their wishes, as long as they believe in the edict of the community. Politicians are very similar to modern times and the Jacksonian Era, although there are no political parties. They can have different ideas on how to serve the community, but instead of pursuing their own agenda, they work together to better serve the community. Affinity is a community shaped very similar to the United States today. The difference is there are clearly defined values and morals that the citizens believe and accept, as condition to live there. By doing what is best for the community, everybody is able to live in a realistic utopia.<br />

					<p>In my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/14675687@N00/399097413/">community</a> , the resident ranges from newborns to the elderly. Anyone is welcome as long as they can accept the rules. Who isn’t allowed in our community are trouble makers and anyone who cannot accept our rules. Our community as a whole is very trusting and caring. Since the population is only 3,000, everyone knows how everyone is and during special events, we all get together to play games and socialize. The layout of my community is very simple and spacious. The brick houses where the residents live are usually grouped together so no one is living by their self alone unless you are the mayor (which is elected by the people of my community) of the community which needs to be separated from everyone else so they can oversee and protect the whole community. Near the homes of the residents are farmlands so they can plant their own vegetables and fruits so they can eat and sell it to the market. Near the farmland are the orchards for clean air and fresh fruits and nuts.  The public building and the park is walking distance so you don’t have to drive to get there even there are roads to get there. On the other side of the river are the woods and the factory mill. You can tell that no one lives there. What is great about this community is that everyone is very hard working therefore, no one is homeless. Everyone is well to do. <strong>There will always be problems within a community such as drinking, sexual behaviors, and complex marriages therefore, we will have to work together to prevent this from happening.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>In order to have a safe and trusting community, we must work together. From my point of view, the residents in my community are always working together when there’s a serious problem going on. Problems such as drinking, sexual behaviors, and complex marriages which are mention on this <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/exploring/19thcentury/simutopia/index.php">link</a>. These problems that are happening in my community is very devastating because not is it only hurting us individually, but it is hurting us as a whole community.</p>
<p>The goal for my community is to solve our most serious problems which are drinking, sexual behaviors, and complex marriages. The reason for solving these serious issues is so that future generations won’t be exposed to these serious issues. These serious issues are damaging and will tear this wonderful community apart. Without the exposure to these serious issues, everyone in the community will be safer and there will not be a lot of kids in the orphanages. In conclusion, these problems and issues need to be solved because it will tear up this community</p>

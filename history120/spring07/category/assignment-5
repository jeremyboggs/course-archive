					<p>Every race has a few stereotypes that follow them where they go.  From Asian people being good at math to Jewish people being very greedy with money, stereotypes have no mercy.  It is very difficult not to offend anyone since there are so many people, keeping racism a touchy subject.  Even in class, when we talk about race or a group of people, we know what the answers are or what the professor is looking for, but since that race is represented in the class, we do not want to offend them and simply try not to be called on.  <strong>Stereotypes label races a certain way and that certain way is how the majority of the population see them as.</strong></p>
<p>A few things have changed, since the 19<sup>th</sup> century, but there still remain stereotypes that continue to label races in order to simplify things.  I found a few pictures in the Library of Congress archives that depict typical <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/436320671/in/photostream/">African-American</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/436320677/in/photostream/">Chinese-Americans</a> in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century.  In the picture with the small child enjoying his watermelon, you see a large chunk of it already eaten.  As you know, African-Americans like watermelon, chicken, and grits, this has been a stereotype for a long time and is even the title to the Nappy Roots album, “Watermelon, Chicken, &amp; Gritz” with a “z” because it makes it that much cooler.  The little boy, named “Watermelon Jake”, is not wearing any shoes and appears to be sitting on a table.  So at this time period, African-Americans are poor people who cannot afford shoes and enjoy watermelon in the summer time to keep them cool.</p>
<p>In the other photo, entitled “The Chinese Must Go!” there are several small pictures showing several stereotypes of Chinese people.  In one picture, there is a line of people waiting to hand there clothes to the Chinese cleaner man who is already hard at work.  In another picture, there is a man inspecting the clothes that a Chinese tailor has finished for him.  In yet another picture, there is a man looking to buy cigars in a Chinese owned Cigar shop.  These are stereotypes of jobs that the Chinese had and in every single picture, they are still wearing their typical Chinese clothing, while the white people have regular trousers, coats, hats, and shoes.</p>
<p>Some of these stereotypes are still valid today.  Of course some of them are not also.  In a photo that I found in the Google search engine, there is a picture of <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/436332436/in/photostream/">Tupac</a>.  This “Gangsta” rapper emerged late in the 20<sup>th</sup> century to become one of the biggest rap icons in history.  This photo also depicts what a typical gangster is, I guess, supposed to look like.  From a huge tattoo across his stomach stating, “THUG LIFE” with a bullet as the letter “i”, to his jeans slung low passed his boxer briefs, to his backwards bandana.  Yet he finds it necessary to wear a crucifix outside of it all.  This “thug” was later gunned down in 1996 in a drive by with his murder yet to be solved.  So when Tupac became rich and famous, he wore better clothes, had more jewelry and was very influential in the music world, but little Watermelon Jake was just a little kid with no shoes enjoying his juicy watermelon.</p>
<p>In the last photo, I found what appears to be a web advertisement for a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/32447721@N00/436332440/in/photostream/">Chinese tailor</a>.  There are dressed in there traditional clothing and the older man is working on a piece of clothing in the background.  The bottom of the picture states “We don’t have a fancy website, but we make the most beautiful dresses.”  It also says that they are made by hand.  This made me think, “Did they wear those clothes on purpose to attract customers?”  You want to make money when you start a business, but I do not think that you have to wear something or look a certain way that you would not normally look in order to attract customers, your work should speak for itself.</p>
<p>Stereotyping is a serious problem that people have dealt with for a very long time.  Some of these stereotypes, although there is some truth, hold back the race from breaking free of the mold that society have put them in.  There are a few pioneers, such as Dave Chappelle, Carlos Mencia, and the creators of South Park that have confronted stereotypes and made them public so that everyone knows what it does.  Now I’m going to get out of my house that has like 20 people in it, drive to school in my Toyota Corolla with Wal-Mart spinners, and stop by Taco Bell before I get to class.</p>

					<p>By definition, a stereotype is a simplified and standardized conception or image invested with special meaning and held in common by members of a group [1]. They can be harmful or beneficial, correct or incorrect, and have been used for many different reasons. Furthermore, stereotypes are always in flux as they are modified to conform to changes in society over time. <strong>Yet, from nineteenth century to present day America, stereotypes have always performed a certain type of “cultural work”, in that they have always been used to define and protect the individuality and uniqueness of any given culture. </strong></p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, the United States experienced a major surge of immigration from foreign cultures that were markedly different than the existing American culture. These immigrants, who were abundant in Irish-Catholics and Chinese, posed a threat by compromising what natives had previously developed as the “American” culture. As a response, immigrants were often mocked and stereotyped in cartoons of newspapers in order to distinguish American traits from alien traits. An example of this can be seen in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44181017@N00/436035716/">this</a> 1880 cartoon from the magazine, <em>Harper’s Weekly</em>, where a Chinese man is depicted coming to America in a tea pot while saying “How e do Melican man. Me comme plenty time. Bling big heap Chineeman”. By using the teapot as a symbol for Chinese culture, this cartoon implies that the Chinese are making America their own home, and not conforming to traditional American values. By pointing out and making fun of the Chinese man’s poor grammar, and exaggerating unfamiliar stereotypical physical features such as clothing, facial structure, and hairstyle, the author helps define what is not American. Thus, in return, stereotypes such as these protect what is American by not allowing alien cultures to blend in. </p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the Chinese were not the only threat to American culture. In fact, prior to the mass immigration of Chinese, Irish-Catholics were the major threat to the existing American culture, which was mainly Protestant. Protestant Americans were afraid the growing number of Catholics would become too influential, and possibly seize control of the government. In magazine cartoons such as <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44181017@N00/436035716/">this</a>, which was also found in <em>Harper’s Weekly</em>, the stereotype that the Irish were ape-like barbarians that were prone to drunkenness and lawlessness was reinforced time and time again. Depicting them in this animalistic manner made all Irish seem untrustworthy, and fueled anti-Catholic notions. This widespread negative preconceived notion about the Irish kept them in check, and helped minimize their influence among American society. Also, by making fun of the drunken, disorderly behavior of the Irish, Americans at the same time were defining themselves as level headed, in control people. </p>
<p>In present day times, America has become a melting pot society. It has become more and more homogenous, and people of different cultures are beginning to lose their discrete identities. As a result, overtly racist stereotypes in newspapers and media (such as the examples above) marginalized significantly in the twentieth century. Yet, stereotypes still do exist today, and are still used to protect traditional cultural values. For example, television commercials often portray the stereotype that drug users are losers, which is a mechanism for promoting a sober, healthy lifestyle to future generations. Similarly, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44181017@N00/436125179/">this</a> image depicts how Uncle Sam teaches us drugs are bad.  Cultural values must be taught to future generations for them to be preserved. Also, because of the melting pot of cultures in today’s America, and the gradual loss of discrete identities among cultures, people sometimes manifest stereotypes given to the group of people they feel most a part of. For instance, if a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44181017@N00/436172883/">Caucasian boy</a> was raised in an African-American community, he or she might wear baggy clothes in hopes to fit in. </p>
<p>As one can see, times have radically changed since nineteenth century America, but stereotypes have always been used to define and protect the individuality and uniqueness of a group’s culture. Throughout history stereotypes have proven to be the cause of many problems and misconceptions, but fortunately, overtly racist ones are becoming less common. But in the end, as long as there are cultural differences, there will also be stereotypes to draw between them.</p>

					<p>A stereotype is a conception or opinion of people made from observations concerning people from a “group”.  Stereotypes can be a positive reflection on a group of people or it can be a nasty reflection. For example, all blondes are stupid, or more seriously, all Jewish people are cheap (negative) or all Asians are smart (positive). Stereotypes are wrong either way since you are saying that every single member of that group is something without knowing any facts. Stereotypes are based on previous experience and then continued on in future experiences with someone different but from that same group. Stereotypes have been around for centuries. Americans did not want the Irish in their country, so instead of understanding them and giving them a chance, they judged them first and formed stereotypes against them. Americans also have seen woman for years as inferior to men, weak, and that they should be only objects that are seen and/or mothers. These and more stereotypes continue on today. New stereotypes of today include, all middle easterners are terrorists and Americans are fat. <strong>Nineteenth Century stereotypes do the same work as stereotypes today; both categorize and both wrongly judge people.</strong> It is not good that stereotypes are still carried on and that new ones are constructed everyday.</p>
<p>In the 1850’s the Irish started trickling over to America to escape poverty and famine, but they were directly unwanted. This can be explained in that Americans were afraid of change and afraid that these illiterate, poor, unskilled people would deteriorate their beloved country that they had recently created. Americans decided to view the Irish as mean, feisty, unruly, and “incapable of becoming American”. They were not given a chance to mingle in society, thus the Irish could not even try to become Americanized. The Irish were viewed the same way the North <a title="Resource" href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/exploring/19thcentury/alienmenace/">viewed</a> the blacks. This stereotype is still accepted today, but a few things have changed. The Irish are still viewed as feisty and rough, but in a more positive way. The “fighting Irish” is a term used to describe them. This <a title="Fighting Irish" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17302319@N00/434589805/in/pool-history120-spring07/">cartoon</a> of the fighting Irish is associated of course with sports. But it depicts the fighting Irish in a good way. Meaning they are tough and will win against the other team. These days being tough and mean are ways of staying alive and surviving. The Irish must have stuck it out and survived since they are welcomed and loved these days. This stereotype changed over time, but not all do.</p>
<p>Women have always been seen as weak, pretty, or just a typical homemaker and mother. Basically one that has no influence on society and an object that should be concerned with appearance. Also, women are seen as those that gossip and talk about things that have no significance. This <a title="19th Century Woman" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17302319@N00/434619175/in/pool-history120-spring07/">picture</a> is from the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Women at that time were seen as inferior to men. They should not work, vote, or have any power. The men were the ones that had all control. Women those days thought their place was at home and taking care of the family because that’s what society was telling them by stereotyping them into this group. Today woman are encouraged to have careers but <a title="Women" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17302319@N00/434619149/in/pool-history120-spring07/">magazines</a> mass advertise ways to look good in the work place. Both photos encourage an attractive appearance and both talk about petty insignificant “gossip”. The magazine clip give secret hints on where to find the best bargains or ways to look pretty in a short time. There is no encouragement to make an impact or columns informing them of important world topics. There are no “hints” on how to work your way to another level in society. Women are still being compressed into the circle of appearance and inferiority.</p>
<p>Stereotypes will forever be present. They may change over time but essentially they still do the same thing, categorize and wrongfully judge. Not all women are concerned with beauty and bargains. Some women work hard and are concerned with politics and ways to improve the world, but it is hard to find help when they are still being seen as pretty objects. I am sure not all Irish men drink and fight regularly. Continuing stereotypes just paves the way for new ones. A new stereotype today is that Americans are fat and infatuated with food, like in this <a title="American Stereotype" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17302319@N00/434589801/in/pool-history120-spring07/">photo</a>. The clip shows a very jolly man, obviously an American, extremely happy to have so much unhealthy food. He does not seem to have another care in the world, he has what he wants. I chose to add this photo because it shows that new stereotypes are created frequently based on the fact that a large number of Americans are overweight. However this leads to an outsider viewing all Americans as overweight. Stereotypes do nothing to fix a problem. Instead they poke fun at the subject and force people to continue to view things the way they are. Stereotypes contribute nothing to society.          </p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Today in the United States certain stereotypes are used arguably for less nefarious reasons than they were in the nineteenth century. That is not to say, however, that modern day stereotypes are any more positive or constructive than those of our past. The stereotype of the lazy, drunken and brawling Irish &#8220;goon&#8221; who looked more like an animal is not significantly more positive to the Irish reputation than the more recent stereotype of the Irish party animal. The difference is that the purposes behind these respective uses of stereotyping are almost complete opposites. <strong>Generally speaking, the &#8220;cultural work&#8221; performed by stereotypes in the nineteenth century was to assist in efforts to exclude and marginalize particular groups who sought acceptance within the American experience, while the &#8220;cultural work&#8221; performed by stereotypes today seems more akin to &#8220;marketing support&#8221; work, aimed at attaching some well known collective attribute to various consumer products for all to enjoy. </strong>While the caricature of the Irish goon was designed and used to keep the Irish outside the bounds of decent American society, the &#8220;party Mick&#8221; is now constantly used to lure others into the happy drinking ways of this lovable member of the big American quilt.</p>
<p>While it would be naive to suggest that there are no longer efforts to exclude and marginalize various groups within the US, it is clear that America is longer a place where overt racism<strong> </strong>can be practiced in the media to the extent it once was in the nineteenth century. The level of social consciousness and moral restraints on overt racism has increased significantly from days ago, and the fact is many ethnic groups that were once on the outside looking in have now worked their way into the current American mainstream. Thus, while attempts to negatively influence the American public’s acceptance of a particular group by way of a blatant stereotype broadcast widely in the mainstream media may have been tolerated in the nineteenth century, they would most likely be regarded as heavy-handed and morally unacceptable in today’s America. In other words, racism and the use of stereotypes in support of racism, must be much more subtle and limited in audience scope today.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the use of stereotypes are powerful ways to communicate a message. Never willing to pass up a way to sell a message, thus, Madison Avenue has made itself all the more effective by playing on the same or similar stereotypes as have persisted through the years - - just with a different twist. This is precisely why, for example, the alcoholic Irishman stereotype has managed to survive. Instead of being portrayed as the feckless, drunken rascal who would bring nothing but crime and disorderly conduct to America, the alcoholic Irishman stereotype has now been watered down a wee bit to represent the new carefree, hard drinking, hard-playing man among men who we should all join and emulate at the nearest bar selling Coors Light. Irish Americans are still being cast as drunks, but they are now acceptable and even lovable – so much so, indeed, that we are all urged to be just like them!</p>
<p>The images I selected to post strongly support the idea that, while stereotypes may stay the same through the years in terms of basic substance, they can change dramatically in terms of their uses and intended purposes. One of the nineteenth century cartoons I posted and the modern day cartoon I posted both address the alcoholic Irishman stereotype. That, however, is where the similarity stops. Clearly, one cartoon intends to use the stereotype to the detriment of the Irish, whereas the recent cartoon seeks to convey a much more positive view of an Irishman with drink in hand. The stereotypical Irish alcoholic who was once an unacceptable threat to decent Americans has apparently been transformed into a vital component of the leisure life of modern America, all through the magic of TV commercials.</p>
<p>I could not figure out how to use hyperlink but, here are some examples. </p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Stereotypes have been a part of the American culture since Englishmen first evaded the country. Stereotypes can be defined as “ideas held about members of particular groups, based solely on membership in that group” (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype">Wikipedia</a>). We are presented with these stereotypes everyday of our lives, and everyday we are pressured to embed these into our culture and lives. Some of the most common stereotypes have to do with women. Throughout history women have had very specific roles that they were forced to play and that is how society has come to portray women. <strong>The “cultural work” that stereotypes did in the nineteenth century is still the same work that is is doing today, which is cause society to view certain groups with these judegements in mind and creates room for even more stereotypes to be made.  </strong></p>
<p>I chose to focus my whole post on the sterotypes that women have and still face today. In my opinion, women have been one of the most discriminated groups in this country throughout  history. The common beliefs behind America was based around men and women struggled to compete. To this day, many women still struggle to maintain their own identities and to create a free life of their own. Consequently, the two stereotypes I focused on are “women are meant to be housewives” and that “being a nurse is a women’s job.”</p>
<p>One of the most significant stereotypes towards women is the fact that “ women are meant to be housewives.” During the nineteenth century, all that women were known for was being housewives and very few actually held positions other than this one. For example, the first picture is an advertisement that does a good job showing this stereotype (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/81916518@N00/430882476/in/photostream/">Housewife</a>). As the world is fighting the famine, her job, as she is a woman, has to do with providing food. In the second picture (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/81916518@N00/430876878/in/photostream/">Housewife 2</a>), we see a more modern day housewife with her duster in hand. The biggest difference between the two pictures is that the today’s housewife looks more worried about her make up then anything else. Which in turn yields the fact that today women not only are supposed to be housewives, but also are supposed to always look good and be ready for anything. As well, both women are seen wearing an apron, leading to that being a sign of cleaning. Both of these made life for women hard, whether in the nineteenth century, or today. It made it hard for women to be taken seriously, which makes it hard for them to break out of their shells and become workingwomen. Men view women as these objects at their disposal and view themselves as the powerhouse. All this in turn makes it hard for women to get jobs and be taken seriously. Though the biggest change in this stereotype is that as women then were silent and took their place, women now work hard to make something of themselves.</p>
<p>Women have always been seen as the nurse. In the nineteenth century, most doctors were men and most women were nurses. In the picture (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/81916518@N00/431024253/in/photostream/">Nurse</a>), we see that the woman is very happy to be a nurse and is the typical portrayal of a nurse. In the more modern drawing (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/81916518@N00/431024255/in/photostream/">Nurse 2</a>), the little girl is seen playing with her stuffed animal, nurse. This is showing that the stereotype of women being nurturing develops, as women are young children. They are trained to know their role and know that they are meant to be nurses.   In a way, this is stereotypical against men as well. It is saying that men who are nurses are gay and laughed at. For example, in the movie “Meet the parents” the main character is a nurse and is teased for it. As well, this stereotype shows that women are not meant to be doctors and shouldn’t be. The biggest reason that we connect women and nurses is because of the attributes we attribute to women. Women are known to be sweet, tender and caring. As well, they are lovable, sincere and sensitive. All these make women and nurses one. Coincedently that is why we choose to not attribute nurses as being male. Men who are nurses in turn are seen as sensitive and caring, making them look gay and foolish in guyish atmospheres.</p>
<p>            Throughout history women have been stereotyped against. It has been common knowledge that women are meant to be housewives and that only women were meant to be nurses. As a result, many more stereotypes can be formed just from these two alone. Not only can more stereotypes be formed, but also as a culture, we choose to view this group in this sense and think that they cannot be anything else.</p>

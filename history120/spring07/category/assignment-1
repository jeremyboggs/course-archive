				<small>Tuesday, February 6th, 2007</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p><strong>    Mulatto slaves had very useful skills and were considered exceptionally valuable.</strong> The chances of escape as a Mulatto Slave where enhanced due to his or her color. As a Mulatto slave, chances of escape where increased since the skin color resembled that of Native Americans. As explained in many advertisements resembling Indians as appose to African American slaves made chances of escape much greater. As many Mulatto slaves disguised themselves as Indians wearing match coats and other Indian apparel, increasing their chances of escape and hiding out amongst Black Indians. Many where found hiding in forests and other wooded areas as they attempted to pass themselves off as Black Indians. It appears that the runaways had to be witty and cunning to portray themselves as freed slaves or a Black Indians.</p>
<p>These ads tell us a great deal about the courage and resilience these men and women had during these times of hardship. Some advertisements had warnings explaining how difficult it was to catch certain slaves. Many would escape again from the slave trackers or would not allow themselves to surrender or be taken alive. These advertisements help show us the mentality and courage of the runways. It took a strong willed person to run-a-way from is his or her master, as these slaves did not know what was waiting for them on the road to freedom. Many Mulatto slaves had acquired skills which were vital to plantations such as carpentry, farming, taming horses, and medicine. Some owners where willing to pay up to two hundred dollars for the return of their runaway slave. At that time that amount of money would equal big bucks today. It is clear that in having such skills as carpentry or horse taming a lot of these slaves could be earning good money as freed slaves.</p>
<p>In most advertisements it seems as if the slave owners are showcasing the talents of the runaway slaves. The way certain texts are written makes it appear as if the slaves made a bad choice and just needed to find there way back to the plantation. They disguise the fact that a human is owned by another human. The Mulatto slaves had a better chance of escape due to their mixed color and their ability to take advantage of that. This history lesson shows us that when people are treated unjustly, they will find ways to rise above it.</p>

					<p>After looking at different advertisement for runaway slaves I learned something different about slaves.  <strong>In each article the slaves were called English servant man or woman rather than slaves or Negro’s and the owners knew them really well physically and their personality.  </strong>Another point the advertisements make is that the slaves use different methods to hide themselves so they can’t be found for example in the article on October 24<sup>th</sup> 1745 <a href="http://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/gos/search/relatedAd.php?adFile=sg45.xml&amp;adId=v1745101395">James Gibson</a> who ran away lied to everyone who he came across and as noted by the owner as a cunning fellow.  Another example of this was printed on November 11<sup>th</sup> 1747 where <a href="http://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/gos/search/relatedAd.php?adFile=md1747.xml&amp;adId=m1747110004">Margaret Barnes</a> who ran away and claims to everyone that she could predict fortunes for others.  The articles that I read did not state what skills the servants possessed and the reason behind that is that the owners did not what to alert others with the skills their servant’s possessed. This might be a problem in the process of getting them back since the servants will do what they do best in to earn a living while away from their masters.<br />
In the last article that I read was the one where <a href="http://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/gos/search/relatedAd.php?adFile=sg45.xml&amp;adId=v1745041377">John Owl</a> ran away from his master and the interesting part on the advertisement was that he ran away last on February 14<sup>th</sup>.  This tells a lot about Mr. Owl who ran away more than once but was found and returned in the previous incidents.  All the articles were very through with the different clothing that they wore right before fleeing off and also different kinds of scars or any other physical appearance that would identify them.  The advertisements did a lot of great thing describing the servants.<br />
Slaves are all kept against their will as said in the wikipedia article of slavery “Slaves are people who are held against their will since either their capture, their purchase, or their birth, and are deprived of their individual freedom for the purpose of exploitation of their labour and in some cases their sexual abuse.” [1]  This tells us that they never had it easy with their masters so in return they ran away and never returned and if found they would try to find another way to escape  such as Mr. Owl who ran away a couple of times.<br />
All these advertisments shows us how much the owners miss their servants because of the output they gave to the owners such as farming, shoe maker and many more other things.  Inaddition the advertisments also pointed out that they were not called slaves but instead called servant man or woman and the amount of information that they owners knew about them.</p>

<p>Reading the Runaways</p>
<p align="center">Running to freedom</p>
<p align="center">
<p>It has been 200 years since we signed the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act on March 25, 1807. Yet we still have little idea on how much the slaves suffered and what their personal lives consisted of. Some tend to forget that they were families that had grandparents and children that were either slaves or never to be seen again. Some slaves had masters that took the chance and educated their slaves just a little hoping that it would allow them to work better, and some wanted to keep their slaves illiterate so they would never survive if they ran away. <strong>There were always runaway slaves and they came in all different types, from every skin color to literacy level, yet they all had one thing in common, the pursuit for freedom. </strong></p>
<p>In the ads that were provided for us from the database <em>The Geography of Slavery</em>, I found that there were many different kinds of slaves that ran away. Some of them in groups and some alone. It was interesting for two reasons, one was because they were stating the qualities that the slave possessed and the other was that the slave had these qualities to begin with. They could read, write, play instruments, use tools that took skill and they were even well mannered and could speak proper English. That was very risky for the owner because they took the chance of loosing their slave. Someone could read the ad and could keep the slave knowing what they could do for them.</p>
<p>The ads helped me understand the history of colonial Americans slavery, it showed a side of slaves that wasn’t shown in most textbooks. The ads portrayed the slaves for who they were, not just a expected depiction of what they assumed slaves to be. From wikipedia it states that “Slaves are people who are held against their will since within capture, their purchase, or there birth, and are deprived of their individual freedom for the purpose of exploitation for their labor…”. That citation shows that slaves didn’t have a choice to become a slave, but they did have the choice to run away to a chance for freedom.</p>
<p>There were runaway slaves and they came in all different types, from skin color to literacy level, yet they all had one thing in common, the pursuit for freedom. In conclusion slaves had qualities that made them who they are. All different and unique to each person, but the common factor that they didn’t possess is freedom, and that is the same thing that puts them in the same category of runaway slaves.</p>

					<p>I read three different slave advertisments. They all had one shared theme running through them. All three advertisements pertained to women who were pregnant. <strong>The advertisements suggested that preganant slaves were not treated like women with children, but instead as a piece of property with slightly more value.</strong><br />
The first thing I noticed in the adverstisement was that all of the women were dressed in &#8220;old&#8221; clothes, and in Virginia made clothes. The old clothes would suggest that their owners did not care enough about them to buy them new clothes. In addition, Virginia-made clothes would suggest that their clothing was made of cotton. Back in the days of slavery, clothes made of cotton were the cheapest clothes one could find. This is both because cotton was very abundant, and also because it is very likely that the slaves made their own clothes out of the cotton they picked.<br />
Another thing which suggested that these women were treated as pure property was the fact that some of them did not have names. In the one advertisement where the woman actually did have a name, the article said &#8220;she calls herself PAT.&#8221; Her owner in the article continually just referred to her as the &#8220;Nego Woman.&#8221; This would show that the owner did not care or respect that this woman had an identity; he could not even show her the respect of calling her by her name. This seems esepcially dehumanizing because even most housepets have a name.<br />
In addition, one side thing I noticed was that most of the women were described as being fat. This description was aside from the fact that they were pregant. This could suggest that they were indoor slaves, possibly cooks, or servants inside. The slaves who worked in the cotton fields all day probably tended to be thinner because they were doing hard labor. Also, one of the advertisements had mentioned that the slave woman was wearing a cooks apron, so that would be more evidence to confirm the hypothesis.<br />
Another thing i noticed in the advertisementswas that one of the rewards for finding these slaves was a pistols. This shows that the owners of these slaves owned guns. They could have complete domination over the slaves because they were literally armed. It would take a lot of courage to disobey or leave someone who had the power to shoot you with a gun. Hence at the same time, this fact also shows the strength of spirit that these runway women must have had to leave their owners. They knew the possible consequences of getting caught but they continued on.<br />
The article in Wikipedia said that slave were only seen as property not as humans [1]. Also the article stated that in the south slaves became the backbone of the work force [1]. The ads help enhance my understading of colonial America with regards to the reading for this week because the ads show how many of the slaves owners didnt even call their slaves by their names. This helps prove that slaves were not seen as human.  In addition, the fact that owner took the time to write the ads and were willing to pay a very high reward for the slaves return it shows that slaves were in fact very important to the slaves owners.</p>
<p>Therefore, in light of the information contained in both the advertisments and the wikipedia articles, it seems clear that slaves were dehumanized by their owners, and considered soley as property. Their indentities, feelings, and health were not important. It also seems clear that women slaves were not treated any better than males, and pregant female slaves were not treated better than non pregnant female slave either. This was obviously a low point in American history, and I am glad our country has overcome this travesty.<br />

					<p>            The lives of slaves are often shrouded in mystery. Growing up as students, we are often taught the bear minimum of our country’s past. We learn the most important details, often excluding supporting facts and events, often excluding details of equal importance. <strong>Runaway ads help historians put these details together in a way to better understand the lives of slaves and the relationships they had with their owners.</strong></p>
<p>            Looking through runaway slave ads, one begins to get an idea of the extremely personal relationship between a slave and his owner. By reading these ads we learn about individuals and the skills they possess, including the most miniscule details. We learn that some slaves had real trades of which they possessed extensive knowledge. The more detailed ads include behavior traits, showing that slaves may not have had hardly any privacy. Living a life of constant supervision would definitely take its toll on a person, making escape a viable option. Slaves were forced to live a life of oppression where their only option of agency was to run away.</p>
<p>            These ads enhance my understanding of colonial American history by giving slaves individual lives. We often learn about slaves as a group, working as a group, living as a group. We often think of slaves as less intelligent, although to no fault of their own with the obvious lack of education and social opportunity. These ads show that in a lot of cases this was not always the truth. Slaves had advanced knowledge of some skills; we learn from ads that some were excellent tailors or excellent blacksmiths. Slaves also show the ability to plan and execute successful escapes; this alone takes at least a fair amount of intelligence to achieve. Ads also give light to areas of behavior, as previously stated. Some ads tell of drunken behavior while others tell of speech habits or limps.</p>
<p>            In the wikipedia article entitled <em>Slavery</em> it says that, “In most institutions of slavery throughout the world, the children of slaves became the property of the master. Local laws varied as to whether the status of the mother or of the father determined the fate of the child; but were usually determined by the status of the mother.” This excerpt shows the cycle of slavery, how a family can lack the opportunity to live a free life or even acquire a free life. Running seems to be the only option left in most cases, an individuals last effort to live a free life.</p>

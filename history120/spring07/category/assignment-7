					<p>In the past five decades society’s perception of women has changed. In the 1950’s, women were homemakers and men we the heads of the home. However, in the average American home does not consists of these two elements. Today, the perception of women is much different than the times our parents.  Over the years women have become equal to men in the home and in the workplace. </p>
<p>The 1950’s were a different world than what it is today. During WWII, lives changed for everyday Americans. Women could not stay at home and be housewives any longer, they had to go out into the workforce while the men were off at war. For years, the women were heads of households, but that all changed once the war ended.  When the 1950’s came around, society tried to put life back in order the way it was before.  The men went off to work each morning and the women were sent back to the homes where they belonged. It was in this time that the Feminist movement began.  At this time in history, and decades before, women were housewives, who came second to men. Women were forced to act, dress, and present themselves in specific ways without any argument. In the cooking clip, it shows how a woman, back in the 50’s, got married and then was tied down to a life of housework and pleasing her husband.  <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=x4qDn0wq4Ng">&#8220;Cooking Terms!&#8221;</a> This clip taught woman how to cook in order to serve her husband.  </p>
<p>As we all know, women are not perceived in this light any longer. Women are no longer expected to stay at home while the men go to work.  Women are even considered equal to men in the workforce, receiving equal jobs and wages.  Women today have come a very long way from where they were just five decades before.  </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPTwyET00X0">Stepford Wives</a> is a movie about a group of perfect families residing in a small town in present-day Connecticut. They were the perfect families because the husbands went to work each morning while the wives stayed home and mended the house.  The women were perfect. They were blondes, they always looked presentable, and they were always second to their husbands.  However, nothing is as it seems, the actual wives were made into robots by their husbands controlled with a remote.  The clip I chose is with Bette Midler’s character as a robot and all of the abilities that make her a perfect wife.  The Stepford Wives, As you can see, not only is her character gorgeous, she is the perfect wife. She cooks, cleans, vacuums, and mows all without ever needing to buy and appliance.  She is even equipped with being able to offer a beer after a night together. She is the perfect wife. </p>
<p>Today, I think that society tries to push more of a balanced lifestyle. No longer do women need to stay at home or either work full time. Today, it is perfectly acceptable and very common to be a working mom.  There is no question that the perception of women has changed in the past 5 decades.  There will always be a select few that feel women are lesser than men, however, as a whole, I think the our society has finally found an equal way of life for us to live. </p>

				<small>Tuesday, April 17th, 2007</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The roles of the everyday woman has changed dramatically throughout history, especially in the last 40 years or so. In the 50’s and 60’s a woman was expected to live for the role of housewife. She was to tend to her children and husband, cooking and cleaning constantly. In the current century a family is still labeled ‘normal’ when the roles are reversed, a man stays home and the woman earns the income. This is due to the ever changing views of society. <strong>Due to the strife of women to prove equal to men in the workplace, the changing depictions of women in different forms of media, and through increased interest in sexuality in our society, the definition of a ‘housewife’ has gained multiple meanings. </strong></p>
<p>The 1950’s and 60’s idea of a housewife can be seen in this video of ‘<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=3dOviPRMoyQ">cooking terms</a>.’ In this video we see a woman who has just been married, the narrator introduces that the honeymoon is now over and its time for her to ‘enter her new kitchen.’ This line shows how at that time, the kitchen was truly thought to be a woman’s place. The video goes on to say that the woman is worrying over the thought of her ability to surprise her husband and produce as great quality of food as his mother. This shows that even women supported the view and their complying actions constricted them to the role. The narrator makes a point of saying that you have to know the ‘following’ terms to be successful in the kitchen, at which time the woman is shown how to ‘cream’ things and ‘mix.’ I feel that this video makes new housewives seem incompetent and inferior to those with years of marriage. However I feel this is an appropriate video that probably aired during its time, and was watched by many. The last important element of this video is the way in which the woman is dressed, extremely conservative, the viewer’s mind isn’t forced to thoughts of sex by mass cleavage being revealed.</p>
<p>The ABC sitcom, Desperate Housewives does a fairly decent job of portraying the change in the expected roles of women today. In this <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=0WV06RcJNPQ">preview</a> we see many different women, engaging in very intimate situations. The preview says “its time to come clean,” then shows two people making out. Also in the preview the women are having lunch together and one of them states that herself and her boyfriend had not had sex yet, they were waiting for marriage. At that point her friend breaks into laughter of disbelief and says, “Oh my God, you‘re serious?” In this previews one minute entirety eight make out scenes are shown, half of which the women are seen in their bra’s and underwear. Just as the preview is about to show the scenes the narrator says “its time for love.” Lastly, the women in this video are dressed more casual and revealing, many of them reveal cleavage when fully dressed, and in the end they are all dressed to fit our society’s view of ‘sexy.’</p>
<p>These two videos differ dramatically, yet both accepted of their time periods. Women have strived to become equal to men in the workplace, therefore changing society’s perceptions and norms from that of the first video, a strict role as housewife, to a more dynamic role acceptance. Also the perceived role a woman should fit has been altered over the years dramatically by media, as we see, the first video is an example of a show aired in the 50’s and 60’s then we shift to the shows common of our time of sex and drama filled relationships, such as Desperate Housewives. I feel the most important and most dramatic factor that has changed the role of women over time is the increased interest and acceptance of sex in our society. Through years of increased nudity and women’s coming into the role as a sexual partner, society has gradually become more desensitized and come to appreciate sex. The phrase “sex sells,” is a common marketing term throughout our society today. This term differs greatly from the target market of the 50’s and 60’s, the housewife of cooking and cleaning. My reaction to the first video was that it was stupid, why would someone watch something so boring and pointless? I viewed the clip as a joke, so I began to analyze why I felt this way. At which point one must imagine how viewers of the 50’s and 60’s would react to an episode of Desperate Housewives, where sex, adultery, and drama are the focus. I’m sure that the viewers of that time period would feel the same way I did towards the video of their time. Most would probably be disgusted, and it would probably be categorized as extremely immoral, pointless. Throughout time the role of women has changed, women are no longer restricted to the role of conservative, cooking and cleaning housewives. The role a woman plays in society has evolved to such a dynamic mold, those who stay true to the ‘old fashioned’ ways, and those who have come to chose who they want to be, and what roles they would like to play in society.</p>

					<p>     In the 1950s it was thought that women only care about the elegance, comfort and other visually appealing features of a car. It was never thought that they would take interest in the mechanical and performance aspect of the car. In modern times women are changing the standard for what type of cars they prefer and it has developed into something very different from the 1950s.  <strong>Over the decades women have developed a different thinking and outlook on the world of automobiles.</strong><br />
   </p>
<p>     I chose to view the video clip <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3qXeZpM__4">“Oldsmobile What Women Want”</a>. This video seemed to be a training video for 1950s Oldsmobile sales associates. It covered what the associates should focus on when selling cars to women. It portrayed woman as people who only cared about the visually appealing features of a car. The video addressed how women only liked the rich quality and the feel of richness in a car. The wide range of colors was something else that the video said appealed to women when purchasing a car. Also mentioned was that women would be interested in the feeling of the interior fabric design like she would on a dress. From this one can assume that the main attire for women was dresses back then. It also talked about how the seat belts of the car were perfect for women because they would not hook the dress under the handle and tear it. This statement again implying that women’s main clothing was a dress.  The video also stated that if the woman is with her husband then the sales associate would not be able to get all of her attention versus if she was shopping alone. So it seems back then if a couple went shopping for a car then it would be the man who made most of the decisions and the women would just accompany the husband but have no real opinion in what car to buy.<br />
     The other video that I viewed was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLnBZA8aMB8">“</a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLnBZA8aMB8">Woman Driver: The Katherine Legge Story Promo”</a>. This told the story of Katherine Legge, a British auto racing driver who is the first women to race a Formula One car in the Champ Car World Series. Everyone predicted that she would fail and not prosper and they said she’s a female in a man’s world. But she worked very hard, was dedicated and proved that she could race a Formula Once car. In a game that crushes the strongest men she won the series opener at Long Beach, in doing this she became the first woman to win a major race in North America. She later went on to win her second and third races at Edmonton and San Jose. This story proves that women have come a long way in the automobile world. It shows that they don’t care merely about the looks of the car nowadays, but that they are interested in understanding the mechanics and performance of the car. I also believe the Legge is a good role model for young girls who are interested in race cars and the mechanics of cars in general. Looking at this story it&#8217;s obvious that women’s thought on cars has no doubt changed from the 1950s.<br />
     </p>
<p>     The Oldsmobile video really just made women look like dummies when it came to cars. It showed them as someone who had no brains and that the sales associate could sell them cars by fooling them into buying a car because of how nice it looked and how elegant and luxurious it was regardless of the performance side of the car. In the 1950s it was thought that the husband would do all the thinking and talking about cars because females were not supposed to know anything about the topic. But looking at the Katherine Legge video it is apparent and evident that women have a new viewpoint in regard to cars. The Legge story shows how a women doesn’t just want to drive a car because of looks but that some women are really into the mechanics and performance aspect of cars.  In 50 years there has never been an intensely competitive female driver in the race world but with Legge’s appearance that has changed. In the 1950s it would have been unimaginable for a woman to drive a race car especially after looking at the Oldsmobile video.  But Legge has proven that women are also interested in car&#8217;s performance and not just the visually appealing and luxurious aspect of cars as they were in the 1950s.<br />
         <br />
     I’m sure though some women still fit into the category of the Oldsmobile video but that’s not the case with many women. Many women nowadays are concerned about the type of performance that their car will give them and that is something they consider when buying a new car. Personally I have a female relative who is very interested in rally cars and she drives a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX.  The Evolution IX is a rally car that is all about performance with very minimal luxury features. So from this we can see that in today’s trends more and more women are favoring the performance and mechanical side of cars versus the elegance and luxury. It is very true that over the decades women have begun to change their perception of cars.<br />

					<p>Women have always been characterized and looked at differently by society as time has passed on through the years. From the way women are looked at in the kitchen and household, how women are looked at by men and their relationships with them, and to how women think about things they buy like an automobile. <strong>Over the time from the 50&#8217;s to present day today, some things have not changed, but a lot of the ways we viewed women today have changed since then.</strong></p>
<p>The movie that I looked at from youtube is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dOviPRMoyQ">Cooking Terms</a> video. I thought that this movie degraded women and made them look like they had no intelligence and could not figure out the basic thing associated with cooking. In the beginning of the movie it shows Margie not being able to figure out the basics of creaming the butter and putting cream into the batter instead of creaming the butter and it messed up her cake. In todays society women are not looked at like that. However, most of the time women are the ones associated with cooking, but in the society today, they are looked at as intelligent individuals and not just a woman who can not figure out the basic things in a cookbook. We do not think of them not being able to follow directions. Another thing is it shows Margie&#8217;s husband going off to work and her staying home with nothing to do, but to cook for her newlywed husband of hers. This is really typical of life in the 50&#8217;s and what was expected of women, to stay home and take care of the house and cook for her husband. Today even though some women are housewives there are also plenty of working woman that do not stay home and have educated jobs. Back in the 50&#8217;s that was very rare to find, a woman working and not staying home. So that is something that has changed. Even though most of the woman that work do come home and make dinner, it is not unusual for a guy to make dinner like it was back then. The other thing that I noticed was how Margie served her husband, like she was his servant. She cut the cake then served him first and then herself. Today women are not expected to serve their husband. Men are expected to be able to get their own food for themselves and not be waited on.<br />
Today the way women are viewed has changed significantly since the 50&#8217;s. In this clip I found of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzEh-3sqiK4">30 minute meals</a>(which is very bad recording and very bad clip by someone with nothing to do) it is proving how things have changed over time. Yes, it is still portraying women in the kitchen, but the show is to show how to make a dinner in 30 minutes or less. This is showing that women are not staying home and that they are out working and do not always have the time to make dinner and this is an easy way to do it. In the video from the 50&#8217;s all the things that were made were time consuming because all the women in the 50&#8217;s were portrayed to have all the time during the day. This is not the cause today because women are working and are not expected to stay at home and cook and clean.</p>
<p>There is another show from today, Food 911 on the food network and its hosted by Tyler Florence. I could not find a clip to show of it, but it is a how to show on cooking. It shows how to make certain foods that people have trouble with. This proves how times has changed because it is hosted by a guy. Back in the 50&#8217;s it would be pretty rare to see a cooking show hosted by a guy, or being portrayed doing a job that back then was thought of as a job that was suppose to be done by a woman. Its proving that women are not looked at as they need to be the ones in the kitchen making dinner in todays societ, that guys are capable of being in a kitchen too. I think it is putting women on an equal level with men, like they should be.</p>
<p>Even though women are still looked at today by some people not equal to men, it is no where close to how it was in the 50&#8217;s. Things have changed over that time span and women are looked at as very intelligent individuals today, not so much then. So even though some people think that women have not made a big movement and are still looked at as lesser individuals by some, it is by far no where close to how they were looked at and thought of back then.</p>

					<p>Throughout history, women have been characterized in many different ways, and unfortunately it is usually in a negative way. During the 1950&#8217;s, it was a popular stereotype that women were homemakers. Although this is not necessarily negative, many men expected this of their wives and women who did not fall into this stereotype were considered to be socially abnormal. Today a few different stereotypes permeate throughout our country, including women as purely sexual objects to women choosing to work neglating their families. Overtime, stereotypes may have changed but still do exist amongst women of today. <strong>The stereotypes of women have changed overtime from housewife to sexual objects, the main theme of  women being subservient to men has continued throughout the generations.</strong></p>
<p>While watching the video, &#8220;<a title="Cooking Terms!" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dOviPRMoyQ&amp;NR=1">Cooking Terms!</a>&#8221; there are many examples of the main stereotype women faced in that day and age as a homemaker. In the opening of the video, we are introduced to Tim and Margie, who are newlywed&#8217;s. Almost immediately we are introduced to the typical roles of husband and wife in the 1950&#8217;s; men went to work and women stayed home to cook. The video states, &#8220;The honeymoon is over for Tim now that he starts back to work. And it&#8217;s over for Margie as she enters her bright, new kitchen to cook her first meal. Yes, can she cook Tim&#8217;s favorite meals, just as his mother used to make?&#8221; The woman is expected to stay home and cook for her husband. Not only is she expected to cook for him, but also to make what he requests and up to his standards. In this scene, you can see how women were expected to please their husbands, with no real thought of themselves.</p>
<p>Another scene that promotes this idea of women being subservient to men occurs when Margie attempts to cook a cake for Tim. However, she misunderstands the cooking term to &#8220;cream&#8221; butter and the cake comes out wrong. The video states how Tim will be suprised and disappointed that Margie ruined the cake. Margie then appears in the scene to be very upset and worried that she cannot cook to please her husband. This is another example of the woman not doing something because she really wants to, but to please her husband. Because she incorrectly cooked the cake, her husband will be disappointed in her. You get the sense from this scene that because Margie cannot cook, she will not make a fit wife.</p>
<p>Finally, near the end of the video, Margie learns what all the terms mean and realizes there is a glossary in the back of her cookbook in case she has any more questions. The video states, &#8220;Now Tim will never have to know about how Margie ruined her first meal.&#8221; This statement again inforces the idea that a woman who cannot cook is regaurded as a failure in the eyes of her husband. The video even goes so far as to say this is one of the most important things you can do in your marriage and throughout your &#8220;career as a cook&#8221;. Therefore, obviously, you are not successful in your life as a homemaker if you cannot cook. These women were expected to please their husbands with their cooking skills and seemingly were considered failures if they could not do this task.</p>
<p>Although women today are not always expected to stay at home and cook for their husbands, there are still ways in which women are subjected to the idea that men are superior in status. For example, many music videos, especially from the rap industry, portray women to be purely glorified sexual objects, at the disposal of men. For example, in the Akon video &#8220;<a title="Smack That" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NInlZ1MnC0">Smack That</a>&#8220;, women are shown in skimpy clothing, dancing around for the men. Even the lyrics of the song are easily recognized as purely sexual, &#8220;Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Taebo/And possibly bend you over look back and watch me/Smack that all on the floor/Smack that give me some more/Smack that &#8217;till you get sore/Smack that oh-oooh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another example of women becoming subservient to men is in the workforce. Constantly there are stories arising of women doing the same work as men, however, they are payed less. Also, there are consistently lawsuits filed by women about being sexually harrassed by men in the workplace. One example of this is a video on YouTube entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGudma-ZY8o">Sexual Discrimination Educational Video</a>&#8220;. This video does a great job of showing things that typically happen to women in the workplace, except it tries to make a joke of the entire thing. The opening credits read, &#8220;How to deal with whiny women&#8221;.</p>
<p>Another scene shows a man (presumably the woman&#8217;s boss), greeting her by name and then smacking her on the butt. The narrator then comes in to tell what he did &#8220;wrong&#8221;, and explains you should not call a woman by her name, but instead refer to women in pronouns or verbs such as &#8220;you&#8221; or &#8220;move&#8221;. While this video may be intended for humor, it is these attitudes that continue to degrade women in today&#8217;s society.</p>
<p>As you can see, while stereotypes of women have seemed to evolve over time, I believe the main focus has continued over time. Women are still expected in many cases to answer to men, whether it is in the household or, today, in the workplace. It is unfair and unjust that this discrimination continues into the 21st century. A woman should have the option to do what she wishes, whether it is to become a stay at home mom, or a CEO of a corporation.</p>

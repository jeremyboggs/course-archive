				<p>There have been a lot of movies produced that reenact the Vietnam War, these include “Platoon”, “Apocalypse Now”, “Forrest Gump”, and “Full Metal Jacket”.  Stanley Kubrick has created several films during his lifetime.  <strong>“Full Metal Jacket” is a film that is told through the eyes of one young Marine that experienced the Vietnam War first hand.</strong>  This film starts off in recruit training, or boot camp, during the Vietnam War era.  The entire film is told in the point of view of one man who enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and goes on to fight in the Vietnam War during the Tet Offensive as a combat photographer.  The events that unfolded during the film were accurate according to history. </p>
<p>“Full Metal Jacket” is narrated, at times, by the main character, Sgt. Davis, also known as Joker.  The very first scene in the movie is when the recruits arrive at Parris Island and are having their hair shaven off while a song plays in the background.  The song that Kubrick chose had a refrain that said, “Goodbye my sweetheart, hello Vietnam.”  This choice of song makes sense since the recruits have enlisted during time of war and they know that they will be overseas to Vietnam in a short amount of time.   The majority of the recruits will go on to become part of the infantry, better known as “grunts”.  However, Joker ends up becoming a combat photographer.  He goes to Vietnam and ends up joining a squad that has a member of his platoon from boot camp in it and takes pictures of them in action.  The rest of the film is of Joker and his photographer partner, Rapture Man, following and fighting along side with 1<sup>st</sup> platoon Hotel 2-5.</p>
<p>The intended audience for this film is anyone who wants to know about the Vietnam War and how the people fighting it felt during their time of “smoking and joking” and fighting.  Stanley Kubrick is known for making off the wall films, such as “A Clockwork Orange”, “2001:  A Space Odyssey”, “The Shining”, and his last film, “Eyes Wide Shut”.  This film is no exception.  From the “This is my rifle, this is my gun” chant in boot camp to the classic “Me so horny” and,” Me love you long time” quotes from the Vietnamese prostitute who offers her services to the hard fighting Marines.  Most of Kubrick’s films are timeless classics that have an endless amount of quotes that we still use today.  The way that he uses music and the settings in his films on not just for show, they all have a purpose.  One example of this is when the Marines are fighting in Hue City.  This battle is best known for being fought for every street and every block.  This fighting was long, tiring, and brutal.  The background, like the destroyed buildings and the shattered ruins of the streets where the Marines waited for the word, was all dark and grey.  He used this to symbolize how the Marines were fighting.  When they were being interviewed by the media, you can tell that they were tired of fighting and not getting anywhere, that they just wanted to get it over with and kill whatever wasn’t American.  “Anyone who is running is a VC, anyone who stands still is a well disciplined VC,” this is a quote that a machine gunner says to Joker when they are flying over a rice patty field and the machine gunner is going gunning women.  This also shows that you could not tell who was a VC and who was not. Kubrick shows this in one of the final scenes of the film.  A Marine, 8 Ball, has to go out and find a way through the ruins as 1<sup>st</sup> platoon is patrolling through Hue City.  He gets shot by a sniper, but it was not a kill shot.  The sniper only shot 8-Ball in the leg so that more members of the platoon would try to help 8-Ball and would get shot by the sniper as well.  This tactic works when another Marine, Doc J, tries to rescue 8-Ball and ends up being shot.  This forces the rest to try to kill the sniper.  Another Marine, the squad leader Cowboy, gets shot in the chest while he is standing next to a hole in a wall trying to make contact with his superiors.  When they finally get into the building, they come across the sniper.  The sniper was a woman.  It was very difficult to decipher VC from civilian since they did not use a uniform.  Men, women, and children were all members of the Vietcong.</p>
<p>Some songs that Kubrick used in this film include “These Boots were made for Walking” when you first see a prostitute in the film; “Paint it Black” as the end credits; the Mickey Mouse song in the final scene after killing the sniper and they are walking through a field and everything around in on fire; and the countless cadence they are chanted during p.t. runs in boot camp.  I went to boot camp in the summer of 2004 in Parris Island, where the first part of the film was shot.  A few things have changed since the release of “Full Metal Jacket”.</p>
<p>The accuracy of this film is up to par, although a few things have changed since.  The rifles featured in the film are the M14 in the boot camp scenes and the M16A1 in the Vietnam War scenes.  Both of these rifles were used in the Vietnam War era.  Today, the Marine Corps is using the M16A4 and M16M4 variants of the M16 rifle.  These new rifles are more accurate, lighter, and more adaptable than the previous versions.  The boot camp scenes were very accurate in the film.  I found myself singing along with the cadence of Senior Drill Instructor Gunnery Sgt. Hartman as they are running down the street in Parris Island.  The lingo that GySgt Hartman used throughout the film is exactly what a drill instructor would say in the boot camp of today.  “Here you are all equally worthless” is what he said when he explained that race and religion have nothing to do with how they will be treated.  GySgt Hartman also talked about Charles Whitman and Lee Harvey Oswald what “one motivated Marine and his rifle can do.”  Gomer Pile killing himself the day before they graduated is a reality.  I would here stories about how recruit could not take it anymore and they would try to escape and hang themselves with belts, shoelaces, or slings.</p>
<p>This is a great film about the Vietnam War.  The story of one Marine as he joins the Marine Corps and fight for his country is one that has been told in several movies.  There aren’t that many films or video games about the Marine Corps, mostly of the other branches, but Stanley Kubrick’s “Full Metal Jacket” is a classic.  The film is very accurate and the way that Kubrick uses music and the setting all have a purpose.  Everyone would enjoy watching this movie, unless you do not like war movies or a movie without a happy ending.</p>

			<div class="entry">
				<p><strong>From 1828-1850, the Jacksonian Era defined the lifestyle in the United States, where unprecedented ventures and reform paved the way for the nation to transition from its current rural mentality into a more capitalistic, industrial, and urbanized way of life.</strong></p>
<p>A utopia would consist of both a religious and socialist community. Religious in the sense that since people were becoming more religious, and not drinking and restricting sexual behavior, and Socialist in the sense that people were moving more towards industrialism and making money and economically succeeding. My utopia will be a commercial enterprise, because our main goal is to make alot of money to improve the standards of living and be better than everyone else. Yet, everyone does their share of equal work. The community supports itself by the majority of it being industrial, but there are still some agricultural, because the entire society has not transformed into industrial yet. Some are still holding on to their traditional agricultural roots and since we want the world to be perfect for each one of our citizens, we understand that about them. Our utopia will also be open to the rest of the world, because our main goal is business and richness so the more people there are that come into our world, the more money we will be makng. It will be urban in character yet there will be no slavery. It will be a little bit of both worlds because we are in transition period when people are going from rural to urban, so our main goal is to satisfy both sides.</p>
<p>Our utopia is also a profit seeking capitalist community that also holds religion in high regards. Our religious faith was has not been forgotten even though money has become our number one priority. For our religious rules; there are restrictions on sexual behavior and drinking, and this will be implemented by everyone. It is a close-knit community and everyone keeps an eye on everyone. All people work equally and have equal and set standards. In essence, everyone will work for their fair share and accumulate all their money in one place and distrubute it evenly amongst everyone.</p>
<p>A Board of Directors is technically the head of the town. They don’t rule over anyone but they meet once a week to hear and set any problems straight. They are who the town people go to incase of emergencies, they know everything that is happening. All members of the community meet once a week in any public building and work together or talk. The way it is set out on the map is, the farms and the people that still farm are set on one side of the river. They don’t think the same way the people who have moved to an industrial way of living think and live their life the way they want to but still would rather be in our utopia. They have their farms and their homes. On the other side of the river is the new “city life” way of living. The factories are set all over the place and homes are all around so that people could live close to where they work. There are parks for families to enjoy their time and publc buildings for the citizens of our utopia to have their needs met just incase they are not.</p>

			<p>This is a very interesting goal. To try to satisfy both the farmer and worker. The only problem here would be how to control growth. The industry could grow and overtake the farms, especially in the capitalist society you are proposing. The Board of Directors seems to me alot like &#8220;Big Brother&#8221; since they know everything that is happening.</p>

			<p>The goal of this utopia haveing a capitalist based economy is a good idea, because all communities require a supply of money in order for them to prosper.  The problem with this set up is that you contradicted yourself becasue a you cannot have capitalism and socialism at the same time.  In a capitalist economy the profits would not be divied up for the sake of fairness, thats not the way capitalism works. This utopia is a far better example of communism than capitalism.</p>

			<p>I think the goal of this Utopia is a good idea. I like having money the main priority. Everything basically revolves around economics and since your Utopia&#8217;s goal would be to make a bunch of money then it would basically control the world. Having control of the economy would give you the power to control what other people do around you because they would basically have to because if they didn&#8217;t then they would be a poor Utopia. So I guess you could do whatever you wanted.</p>
<p>The problem that I see is the idea that you want to be better then everyone else. Even though that might not be a bad idea, it probably isn&#8217;t safe for your Utopia. Everyone else will get tired of you trying to control everything and will probably eventually take actions on it and attack your Utopia to try and get you out of power. Throughout History everyone that has tried to be better then everyone else has eventually fallen because they got to greedy, except the US, but that could happen at one point.</p>

			<p>I could really relate to your simutopia. Mainly on the fact that we both set up our community in practically the same way. Just like you did, I placed my houses and farms on one side of the river, and like you said the “city life” on the other. It makes life easier when people have their space and are able to feel as though they are running their own matters. You had some really good ideas. </p>
<p>I really like how you went deep inside your community and explained everything behind it. Your descriptions really made it easier for me to visualize your community and life in it as well. I also enjoyed the fact that you spent so much time discussing how money was an important aspect of your community. I only wish that you would have included a visual of your utopia through this post for better visual. I also had a little trouble trying to understand what your main objective in your paper was. Other than that, I thought it was good!</p>

			<p>This is a very interesting essay.  I don’t think I can imagine someone who considers themself very religious also stating that religion is anything but the number one priority in their life.  This is a very interesting concept, but I doubt it will win over any true believers, however like in today’s America you will be in no short supply of hypocrites seeking spiritual enlightenment, but only after the have sought financial fulfillment.<br />
As for your idea of separating farmers from the industrial apparatus, you give no ideas on how to prevent the industrial apparatus from overflowing into the agricultural sector.  I only point this out because this overflow has happened in every industrial society since the beginning of the industrial age.  Proof of this overflow can be seen in the never ending sprawl that is Northern Virginia.</p>

			<p>The edict the beginning is awesome, it seems like it is out of Aldus Huxley’s “A Brave New World”.  The essay is very well written and offers a few very good ideas.  The problem I see with this society is that they are trying to have their cake and eat it to.  In my opinion man can either be conditioned to be a selfish being or a community oriented being, but never both at the same time.  Also in the last paragraph you state that “every citizen has the possibility of achieving their wishes, as long as they believe in the edict of the community”, this statement makes the idea of individualism impossible.  It is impossible because individualism at its very core is believing what you want and in a society that forces a set of beliefs on it citizens, no matter how few, true individualism can never be achieved.</p>

			<p>I thought you had good ideas, but they weren&#8217;t explained the right way. Your main focus was making money, but what about the ethical problems such as theft, cheating, lying, etc that is produced by this money-making based mentality. Another problem I saw was that you contradicted yourself when at first you stated that you wanted a capitalist economy, than you said everyone will be getting same share of money (isn&#8217;t this a socialist economy?) Overall the essay was very well constructed and very interesting.</p>

			<p>Your Post is great and explain alot about your town, yet i cant make the connection from emphisizng making alot of money with not having a central factor or mill. the problem is that you town is too spread out, there are not alot of connections which you need to have inorder to succeed in the business world.  I do like however that there seems to be a &#8220;town Center&#8221; with the 3 corners being public building and the last corner being a central park almost. that is good to have a center for the town because then the citizens can build off that later in the towns existence.</p>

			<p>I really enjoyed read your post, I think this is very good post and I like a lot.  After read your blog, I have a lot of thought about how to make better city for people live. The main thing about your simutopia is everyone has money and revolves around economics. I think that is very important to every place in the whole world. A town can not run it without good economics; people always go to richest place for living. Because they know they will have better life in those places, so they make more money. However, I believe not every one will make enough money for living, so the place might not be safe. If everyone can make more money and there will not have unemployed. That town will be the best for people live.</p>

			<p>This essay was very well written and had a lot of great ideas.  I liked how you put the houses and the factories all over the place so that you can live close to where you work.  This will be very helpful to the worker&#8217;s and is a very good idea.  No worker wants to travel far back and forth from their job and in you utopia you have solved that. </p>
<p>Where is your utopia though?  It was kind of hard to understand what you were talking about without actually seeing what you were trying to prove.  Another thing I didn&#8217;t really like it when you said &#8220;It is a close-knit community and everyone keeps an eye on everyone.&#8221;  This can get really interesting in a bad way.  For example if somebody rats someone else out for doing something bad.  Then there can be a huge problem with your factory.  But all in all it was a well-written essay and had good ideas.</p>

			<p>Having a Board of Directors is a great way to direct the people in your community.  If there are no set rules, or laws to abide by then your utopia will definitely not be successful.  It is important to set rules so people do not live in the mindset that they are free to do whatever they want with no obligations.  I also like how you stated your community thinks of religion as a priority.  I agree that this will help people to respect one another and it is also a great way for them to cooperate with others living in the community.  </p>
<p>I did not like how you put living rich and having a lot of wealth as the first priority of your utopia.  It is great to have success, but focusing on money will only lead to competing with other businesses.  It seems very likely that this could stir up feuds between a lot of the people.  If they can only think about money as a major importance it life, I believe your people will never live in contentment.  Thus these people will practice greed and selfishness.</p>

			<p>I find it hard to belive that a town would run peacefully without any rules. I also dont think it&#8217;s a good idea to have the factories, farms, and homes be all together. The factories wouldn&#8217;t provide a safe environment for the homes and the crops from the farms would probably not be there healthiest from the smoke. I think the idea behind this utopia is a nice idea, I just don&#8217;t think it would work out.</p>

			<p>Well I think your utopia is a good idea in theory. I really like how its set up, seperating all the farm land and city life. I also really like how you have it set up with a Board of Directors for people to go to with their problems, and town meetings for everyone to be able to sit down and talk with one another. I think this would provide for good communication and less problems being handled with violence.</p>
<p>I do agree with the others that not actually having a strict set of rules and regulations could potentially backfire. While it&#8217;s nice to think that people will come together and the meetings and talk their problems out, we all know that this is not always the case. Overall, I think it&#8217;s an interesting concept that could work in a small community.</p>

			<p>Many things about your utopia are similar to mine. Having money as your main priority is a good one, because it brings about happiness through better standards of living. I find it very smart to deal with problems, such as drinking and sexual behaviors, through religion. I believe that people will be problematic and weaken their society if they do not fear some type of god. Also, the structure of your post was professional and easy to follow.</p>
<p>One problem with your utopia is that if people aren’t rewarded individually for hard work, they wont have any incentive to go the extra mile. People will have different opinions on what how much work constitutes a “fair share”, and if one person slacks off and gets away with it, others are going to catch on and try to do the same, which will crumble your economy. Overall I think you did a good job. The only thing I would suggest is to have an economy where there is a trade market, and people have incentives to work hard.</p>

			<p>Your utopia will is a natural case of &#8220;prisoner&#8217;s dilemma.&#8221;  This is where someone, or a group of people, will slack off in doing some work because they know that in the end they will still get paid or get their fair share.  Even though your society is about money first, then religion, people are naturally lazy and will not work harder for that money, expecting to get the same amount.<br />
It makes sense to have the best of both worlds in your industrial and agricultural society, but I don&#8217;t think that it is a good idea to seperate the two from one another.  You have farm people living near the farms on one side of the river, and the city people living near the businesses on the other side.  This is bound to cause a rift in the two when they come together in the weekly gatherings.</p>

			<p>Your utopia needs rules and guidelines to make it run peacefully, without them there will be chaos and confusion.<br />
It seems to me that the main idea in your utopia is making money but you disregard the societal problems that plague the general population. I agree with one of the comments that many of these problems arise because of the greed to make more and more money. Your essay did have good ideas and is well written.</p>

			<p>You blog was very interesting, after thinking about what you wrote it seems somewhat like communism. Thats just my opinion  from what i read. I understand you want to make your community profitable however its is important to understand how this will be possible if each person is not induvidally accountable. Your description of what you want for your simtopia was good. Good description and grammer.</p>

			<p>All I could think of while reading your post was that line from The Shining- &#8220;All work and no play makes Johnny a bad boy.&#8221; I really think this rings true for your community. Besides the parks, it doesn&#8217;t seem as though you have anything for your people to do to have fun. The only motivation I could see for people to live here would be to earn a bunch of money, since you said your utopia&#8217;s main goal was to earn money. But if that&#8217;s your main goal, then how are your people still highly religious? How would that work? If your society is geared toward money and profit making, it seems as though that would make them greedy. And seeing as greed is one of the seven deadly sins, how can they be that way but still be deeply religious? And you would have to define restrictions on sexual activity, because you don&#8217;t want your community to go extinct.</p>

			<p>Although your post was clearly different than the others, which I commend, it felt particularly cold. The idea of everyone in your community to be &#8220;better than everyone else&#8221; outside your community doesn&#8217;t seem like a genuine value a community should strive for. The main goal should be peace, safety, and overall happiness for the habitants, not being better than others. I do, however, like how you discussed that bringing in financial gains is key to raising the standard of living, because that is true, but it doesn&#8217;t need to be put in such materialistic terms.</p>

			<p>Your post was interesting. Your Utopia differed a lot from my utopia in that your revolves around money and economics. Even though I do agree money is an important factor it should not be the main focus of your community. Your utopia doesn’t sound like a nice and friendly place to live. It seems like life in your community is a competition and one is trying to be better than the other.</p>
<p>Overall, your post was interesting and different. I enjoyed reading it. I think the people living in your town will have so much money that they won&#8217;t know what to do with it all. Good post.</p>

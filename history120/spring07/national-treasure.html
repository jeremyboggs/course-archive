				<p><strong>A huge part of what history is is finding clues and piecing them together. Especially difficult is figuring out pieces of history from hundreds of years ago. There are always clues that lead to another and lead to another before any real important facts are discovered. </strong>This is exactly what the movie <u>National Treasure</u> is about. In this movie, Ben Gates goes on a hunt to find the infamous treasure that is worth hundreds of billions of dollars that was buried somewhere underneath The Charlotte by the group the Masons. He pieces together the clues that have been passed down through his family since the 1800’s. The first clue is that “it lies beneath The Charlotte.” They are then brought to a clue that is on the back of the Declaration of Independence, which next brings them to the Liberty Bell in New Jersey. They finally find the large treasure underneath a church in a hidden underground room. To make the search even harder, millionaire Ian Howe is trying to beat them to the treasure to claim as his own, even if it means killing anyone that gets in his way.</p>
<p>The overall goal of this movie is to tell the story of a hunt for a treasure that’s worth is inconceivable to even think of. I found it really fascinating the way they turned everyday American symbols into a treasure map. Such as how Gates was able to piece together that the row of numbers hidden on the back of the Declaration of Independence corresponded with a group of letters Benjamin Franklin wrote to a newspaper under the name of Silence Dogood. I really enjoyed this movie because I have always found this type of historical fiction captivating; to today my favorite book still is <em>Angels and Demons</em> which has this same type of hunt.</p>
<p>            <u>National Treasure</u> is shown from the point of view of the main character, Gates. For the most part it follows him on his path to find the mythical treasure. This movie really shows our founding fathers in a good light. The whole reason they buried the treasure in the first place was because they didn’t think any man could handle that amount of wealth, not even a king. I think that this movie could help kids find history even more fascinating than it already is. If an adult like me found this movie to be mesmerizing, I know a kid would probably find it even better. With its rating of PG and being created by  Disney, I think it was intended for all ages and to be a movie to make anyone spellbound by history like so many of us were in our younger age.</p>
<p>            This movie is very much historical fiction; while there are many real historical facts and symbols, I honestly don’t believe that there is a map made of these symbols that lead to a treasure. Although they bent the truth a lot in different scenes, I think they did it for good reasons which led the viewers to think, “what if this really was true.” I googled some of the “facts” from the movie to see if they were completely true, and some of them were. Such as Silence Dogood, who was the first pseudonym that Benjamin Franklin created. This movie helped make history interesting, even if a lot of it was just a story. It was a captivating movie that honestly led me to wanting to learn more about symbols in it. I am excited to have learned there is also going to be a sequel to this movie.<br />

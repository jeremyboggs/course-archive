			<div class="entry">
				<p>The movie <u>A Time to Kill</u>, originally produced by writer John Grisham, and as a movie directed by Joel Schumacher, is a story of events taking place in a very southern part of Mississippi. This drama shows an African American girl is raped by two drunk white men, her father realizes these men will probably never be formally charged, so he shoots them. This event ignites all of the racial tensions boiling among the people living in the town. <strong>Through showing the unfair treatment of African Americans even after desegregation, the treatment Matthew McConaughey endures for being a white man as a lawyer to a black man, and the use of the Klu Klux Klan, <u>A Time to Kill</u>, although fictional, offers a powerful depiction of racism and how it is simply cruel and wrong.</strong> This movie should be seen by everyone, although it defiantly more effective in reaching women as it sparks emotional reactions due to family events and unlikely friendships.</p>
<p>This movie is most effective at showing how unfairly African Americans have been historically treated, even in judicial situations, law that should be fair, just wasn’t for them. In the movie, as Carl Lee, the father of the African American girl who was raped, is on trial. There are many indications he will not be tried fairly. First, the jury that will be deciding of his punishment is made up of mostly middle to later aged white members from the town. The people of the jury had the same mindset as many people historically did shortly after segregation, that whites are superior to blacks and they should not be treated equally. Also, the judge who is presiding over the case is an old man who is friends with the brother of one of the men Carl Lee killed, and is also unspokenly known as a supporter of the old ways of the south. When asked for the trial to be relocated to ensure fairness, Carl Lee is denied, as could be expected during that time period, and of a town who would love to see an African American suffer.</p>
<p><u>A Time to Kill</u>, shows the treatment one supporting an African American in a southern belief town, might go through. Matthew McConaughey becomes Carl Lee’s lawyer. As a result the angered white members begin calling his home with death threats to him and his family. At this point the KKK, a white supremacy group who have real existence and are still around today, comes into the picture. A Cross is burned on McConaughey’s front lawn, something a KKK group would sometimes use as a warning to future victims. They eventually blow up McConaughey’s home. This portion of the film, based on historical events can be seen as a possibility in this situation. This is part of the hatred that existed between the North and the South, slavery, were whites really superior?</p>
<p>There are two powerful moments in the movie that prove the color of skin has no difference on who we are. First, there is a man who takes part in the KKK events, but ends up calling and warning the police before things happen. This shows that the man felt that it was wrong, but it also shows the extreme pressure there was for a white male to conform and unite with other white males to defeat the African Americans. The Civil War proved just how much hate and tension non conformity can cause, we went to war against ourselves, partly or I would say mostly, over slavery. There is a scene in the movie that occurs outside of the courtroom that is very symbolic to the Civil War. A massive fight breaks out between the African Americans and the whites standing outside the courtroom, the police are forced to break up the fight, sometimes having to hit and knock out members. Here the police resemble brothers, and at one point one of the deputies protects one of the black members and one of his fellow officers says, “well who the hell’s side are you on?” This moment shows how the police officer who should have represented neutrality had sided. This really can be analogous to the North and South and how divided they were. The second most powerful moment is when McConaughey gives a testimony to the jury. He dramatically tells them to close their eyes and imagine, he goes through the whole scene of the little girl getting raped, at the end he says, “now imagine she was white.” This is when you see that some people have come to the realization that if a black man had raped a white girl, the town would have rejoiced that one less African American was around, and possibly made the generalization that all African Americans are such savages. They also recognize that when considering their own daughters, Carl Lee’s actions were not that shocking. These two elements of the movie give the backbone of how racial tensions are a hate over skin color, and that inside we are all the same.</p>
<p>One of the unrealistic parts of the film is in the end, Carl Lee goes completely free. Being an African American of that time and also, having killed two white men, it is very unlikely that in real life this would have happened. Although if in real life people had actually witnessed these strong testimonies and were open to realizations, which of that time were also probably unlikely, Carl Lee probably would have served a lesser sentencing.</p>
<p>Overall, historically speaking, <u>A Time to Kill</u> shows a powerful depiction of the deep rooted problem that often times divides the United States, racism. In sequence of events it shows how people have gone from deep hate over skin color, to finally coming to the realization that we aren’t that different from our neighbor of a different skin tone. The film really causes you to think about what you would do in the situation Carl Lee would do, would your sudden instincts be that different than his? Also by reflecting on the film, many emotions are revealed such as shame and guilt upon realizing at one point we have probably all felt and experienced some type of racism. The movie promotes our blending, and upon watching has a lasting effect on all those who watch it. <u>A Time to Kill</u>, truly brings out the ignorance in racism and puts those to shame who take part in it.</p>

			<p>Good and well thought out post! When I first heard about this movie awhile back, I somehow knew that it will be good. I watched this movie a long time ago and thought that it was very moving. As a father, no one should ever go what he went through. In the end, there was a happy ending that made a mark in history. What I like about this post is that the post author clearly explains the gist of the movie including facts if it happened today in today’s society. The part of this post that really moved me was when “now imagine she was white.” As the post author has mention, we are all the same and it is only our skin color that makes us different. I also like the fact that the post author has included scenes from the movie to show its audience as if they were watching the movie. What I didn’t like about this post is the confusing part where the post author writes “This is part of the hatred that existed between the North and the South, slavery, were whites really superior? I didn’t know if the post author was telling us a fact or asking us a question.</p>

				<h3>Contacting the Instructor</h3>
<p>I am more than happy to talk with you about the class, about your work, and about any questions or concerns you may have about college in general.You have several options through which you can contact me. They are as follows:</p>
<h4>Phone</h4>
<p>My office phone is 703-993-9278. If I do not answer, please leave a message with your name, number, and the reason for your call. I do not discuss grades by phone; if you wish to discuss your grades, please make an appointment with me.</p>
<h4>Email</h4>
<p>Please use your university email address when contacting me by email. I will send all class announcements and personal correspondence to your GMU account (as does the university), so check it regularly. You can have your GMU email forward to another service such as Google Mail or Yahoo! Mail, but I will send mail only to your GMU account. Again, it is not my policy to discuss grades by email, so if you wish to discuss grades, make an appointment with me. When contacting me by email please use HIST120: Your Subject in the subject line. This enables me to (1) differentiate your email from the hundreds of others I receive; (2) make sure your email isn&#8217;t filtered into my spam inbox. Subject lines like &#8220;Hi!&#8221; or &#8220;Need Help&#8221; are less helpful than &#8220;Question about Blog Assignment #3&#8221; or &#8220;Thoughts on Zinn&#8217;s Interpretation of the New Deal&#8221;. Try to make your subject lines fairly descriptive of what your want to discuss in the email.</p>
<h4>Instant Messenger</h4>
<p>I have instant messenger accounts with AOL (jboggs22), MSN Messenger (jeremyboggs) and Yahoo! (jeremyboggs).  I am happy to chat about assignment questions, follow-ups on lectures and discussions, and minor technical issues regarding TypePad. Like phone and email, I will not discuss grades by instant messenger.</p>
<h3>Honor Code</h3>
<p>While I encourage students to discuss assignments and critique others&#8217; work, the work you turn in must be your own. You may not copy the work of other students or copy work published elsewhere. You may not have other students complete the work for you. If you wish to cite published works (books, internet sources, images), you must include an academic citation. If you have questions about whether the manner in which you complete you work will be an Honor Code violation, contact me before the assignment is due, not afterward.<br />
All Honor Code violations, no matter how small, will be forward to the Deanâ€™s office with a recommendation for punishment.</p>
<h3>Attendance</h3>
<p>I leave the responsibility of attendance up to you. Though I plan to take attendance before each class, I will not give an attendance or &#8220;class participation&#8221; grade. As college students, you should be responsible for yourselves and for your intellectual development. Keep in mind, however, that all the assignments for this course draw extensively from class discussions and presentations. Thus, failure to attend class regularly can have a detrimental impact on your grade.</p>
<h3>Reading &amp; Writing</h3>
<p>Reading and writing make up the vast majority of work for this class. Because George Mason University has made a commitment to improving student writing, instruction in writing constitutes a significant portion of this class. If you need assistance with your writing, contact the <a href="http://writingcenter.gmu.edu/services/">George Mason Writing Center</a>.</p>
<p>One of the best lessons I can give you as college students is how to read in college. You will quickly learn that, in some cases, Iâ€™ve assigned far more than you can read in a week. Most professors in other disciplines and in other classes do the same thing. It is a way of life in college.</p>
<p>Some resources you might consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Timothy Burke&#8217;s <a href="http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/?page_id=84">How to Read in College</a></li>
<li>Dartmouth&#8217;s <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/success/reading.html">Reading Your Textbooks Effectively and Efficiently</a></li>
<li>Zachary M. Schrag&#8217;s <a href="http://schrag.info/teaching/index.html">Guidelines for History Students</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>
<p>If you are a student with a disability (cognitive, sensory, mobility, or other) and you need academic accommodations, please see me and contact the Disability Resource Center (DRC) at (703) 993-2474.  All academic accommodations must be arranged through that office.</p>
<h3>Technology Requirements</h3>
<p>This course requires basic computer competency. That is, you should be familiar with (1) a computerâ€™s operating system and basic features; (2) sending and receiving email; (3) opening a web browser and searching/surfing the Internet. I hope that you learn a few more computer-related skills in this course. If, however, you are vehemently opposed to using a computer or the Internet, this is not the course for you.</p>
<p><em>A Word of Warning:</em> I will not accept technology-related excuses for late or incomplete assignments. Computers, like many other things built by human beings, are imperfect. A computer or other technology-related problem can occur (and probably will occur), so you should take steps to minimize these problems. Back up your work obsessively. Complete your assignments as early as possible. If your computer shorts out,  your hard drive crashes, or the Internet goes down, make sure you have access to other computer resources. There are several computer labs for students on campus, which you are free to use.</p>

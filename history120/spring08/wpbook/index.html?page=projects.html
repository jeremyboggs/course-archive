		<h2>Assigned Weblog Posts</h2>

<p>Assigned weblog posts refer to posts that are tied to a specific assignment given in class. These posts have specific goals, questions, and requirements, all of which are outlined in the assignment. Four (4) assigned weblog posts are required for this course. Each is due at 5:00PM on the due date stated in the syllabus schedule, and is assigned by group. Points will be awarded for the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Promptness (0 or 20 points – 5 points will be deducted for each additional day late)</li>
<li>Introduction (0-10 points)</li>
<li>Thesis (0-20 points)</li>
<li>Argument (0-20 points)</li>
<li>Evidence (0-10 points)</li>
<li>Grammar (0-10 points)</li>
<li>Format (0-10 points)</li>
</ol>

<p>Total: 100 points</p>

<p>Assigned weblog posts should be between 350-500 words (roughly 1.5-2 pages). While they are relatively short pieces, they will involve considerable time and effort to compose. Below is a brief guide to help explain how I will grade blog posts:</p>

<h3>Promptness</h3>

<p>Punctuality is a virtue. Assignments that are submitted on time receive full credit; late assignments are docked 20 points. Late assignments have one week’s grace period, but lose an additional 5 points for each subsequent day late. After that time, they receive no credit or a zero.</p>

<h3>Title & Introductory Paragraph</h3>

<p>A good post begins with a good title. A good title gets the reader's attention immediately and sets the tone for the rest of the entry. A title, such as “Entry #1,” is not particularly effective or even interesting. Since this is a class, you must number the entries so that the reader knows which assignment you are addressing. Examples might include: “Assignment #1: Reading the Runaways” or “Reflection #2: The Patriot.” You can be much more creative, but your post must have a number referring to the number for the assignment and kind of assignment. And if you use a catchy title that might be confusing or ambiguous, be sure that the document title(s) is indicated in the first paragraph.</p>

<p>Once you've decided on an interesting title, the next step is framing an introduction. An introductory paragraph can take many forms, but in a blog post, two strategies are usually successful: the brief anecdote or narrative or the quotation. How might these work? Here are two examples.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The New Yorker magazine observed, “We believe that the truth can turn up in a cartoon, in one of the magazine’s covers, in a poem, in a short story,….” The New Yorker statement might well apply to the British reactions to events preceding the Revolutionary War depicted in an early cartoon. [The quotation]</p>

    <p>In 1770, Boston citizens skirmished with a small band of British soldiers in front of the Customs House. Although witnesses to the event differed on who was responsible for the starting the altercation, the results were not in dispute—five dead Bostonians. Four years later, the women of Edenton decided to oppose the British Tea Act by boycotting tea. [The short anecdote or narrative]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last sentence of the introductory paragraph should be the thesis. You should be aware that it is acceptable (and often necessary because of time constraints) to skip the introductory sentences in an essay examination question and begin immediately with a thesis statement.</p>

<h3>Thesis</h3>

<p>A thesis is a proposition or statement of an argument. It is not “stage direction” (e.g., “In this paper I will tell you about the British and American attitudes toward pre-revolutionary activism, and then I’ll show…). An adequate thesis is a clear, precise, declarative statement:  “The British cartoon ‘Women of Edenton, North Carolina,’ suggests that the British attitude toward patriot activism was _________ and _________.” Obviously, your interpretation of the source will determine what you put in the blanks. Note, too, that this statement identifies the source. You are required to bold your thesis statement to receive credit for it.</p>

<h3>Argument</h3>

<p>The body of your post follows the terms of your thesis and outlines your argument, beginning with a transitional sentence. (The easiest way to frame a transitional sentence is to take an important word or phrase from the sentence in the preceding paragraph and build on it.) In the Edenton example, the next paragraph would discuss the first “blank” and include the supporting evidence. The second paragraph would follow with a discussion of the second “blank” (usually its best to put the most compelling evidence last) and its evidence. The third paragraph would contain the conclusion.</p>

<p>A conclusion not only summarizes your argument—usually in a sentence or two—but also discusses its historical significance. The last is the most critical. A conclusion puts your argument into “the big picture,” as Richard Nixon was fond of saying. It is an effort to relate your findings to a broader theme in the course. Does Edenton cartoon say something about how the British viewed patriot seriousness of purpose? Does the image offer any insights into British and American views on gender and politics? Et le voilà—your blog post is finished, and you have a nicely ordered 3–4 paragraph post.</p>
<h3>Evidence</h3>

<p>Evidence is a summary description or a short quotation from the source that supports the point that you wish to make in your paragraphs or provides an attribution for an author’s idea. For example: “The cartoonist suggested that the patriotic women of North Carolina were ________ and __________ by depicting the women’s careless parenting (the child under the table) and slovenly housekeeping (spilled food and the dog’s urinating under the table).” If you use a quotation from a source other than the documents that are part of the assignment, you must use quotation marks and a citation. Since footnotes and endnotes are difficult to achieve on the web, we’ll go with the bracketed reference mark [1] at the end of the sentence containing the quoted material and a bracketed reference mark at the end of your post with the source.</p> 

<h3>Grammar</h3>

<p>Grammar and mechanics are important for a variety of reasons—all of them good. All your posts should be grammatically correct in all of their particulars. Correctness includes spelling, punctuation, diction, and mechanics. If you need help with your writing or if I suggest that you visit the Writing Center, you can contact the Writing Center online to make an appointment.</p>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Online writing and reading differs from print for a variety of reasons. Clarity is the name of the game. Each post must conform to the following format:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assignment number</li>
<li>Post title</li>
<li>Bolded thesis sentence</li>
<li>Space between paragraphs</li>
<li>Titles of books should be italicized, titles of articles or documents should put in quotation marks, and so on.</li>
<li>Use text links to comments should use the author’s name. Do not simply use a URL.</li>
<li>Use text links to sources on the web. Do not simply use a URL.</li>
<li>Use footnotes, properly formatted, when appropriate.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Class Reflection Posts:  200 points</h2>

<p>Ten (10) class reflection posts are required for the course. These posts are simply reflections on the topic we cover in a given class. They are due one week after class, or by Mondays at 5PM. These are entirely free form, have no word-count requirements, or any of the formatting requirements for Assigned Blog Posts. This is an opportunity to extend the class discussion, pose questions, or reflect on something you found interesting in class. More than anything, I would like these posts to show that you’re actively thinking about the material we’re covering in class. Consider these posts as an opportunity to express some intellectual playfulness.</p>
<ul>
<li>20 points = Solid engagement with the materials read and covered in class; Good, thoughtful questions and answers; Shows a satisfactory understanding of the topic.</li>
<li>10 points = Weak engagement with the materials read and covered in class; Lacks an understanding of the topic; makes no attempt to actively engage with the materials and discussion from class.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Blog Comments:  200 points</h2>

<p>You are required to comment on the Assigned Blog Posts (not class reflection posts) written by each of your fellow students in your group. I will grade ten (10) blog comments you make on assigned blog posts written by other students in your group. I will choose ten randomly, and each is worth 20 points. Comments are due one week after the deadline for the blog post, or by Mondays at 5PM. After that time, you can continue to comment on posts, but they will not count toward the ten required comments.</p>

<h2>Wikipedia Assignment: 200 points</h2>

<p>For this assignment you must create a user account on Wikipedia. The Wikipedia Assignment includes four parts, all of which must be completed to get credit for the assignment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Topic - I must approve your topic before you get credit for this. If this is not completed before the due date, I will deduct 50 points from your final Wikipedia Assignment grade. Due Feburary 11.</li>
<li>Bibliography - You must publish a tentative bibliography to your weblog by March 24. As with the topic, if this is not completed before the due date, I will deduct 50 points from your final Wikipedia Assignment. The bibliography must explain why you’ve chosen the items in your bibliography, and must include at least the following:
	<ul>
	<li>4 Wikipedia articles</li>
	<li>2 external websites</li>
	<li>2 published books. Not encyclopedia entries.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Wikipedia Article – Contribute a 350-500 word article to Wikipedia. Due April 21.</li>
<li>Wikipedia Reflection – Write a 350-500 word blog post about (a) what happened to your entry after it was published, and (b) what you learned from writing for, and doing readings with, Wikipedia. Due May 12.</li>
</ol>

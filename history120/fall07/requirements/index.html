		<h2>Requirements</h2>
			<div class="entry">
				<h3>Wikipedia</h3>
<p>No books are required for this course. I will primarily assign various related articles from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>, a free, online encyclopedia using “wiki” software, and the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States">Wikibook: U.S. History</a>.</p>
<p>You may be surprised that I use Wikipedia, but here&#8217;s why: Textbooks are largely compendia of facts with little analysis, just like encyclopedias. I do not teach to a textbook, so I have decided to let you use this free resource to acquire the facts you need to do the historical analysis we&#8217;ll be doing this semester. Historical analysis and acquiring facts are two very different things; you certainly need facts to engage in historical analysis, but collecting facts in and of themselves is not analysis.</p>
<p>Be aware that anyone, anywhere, anytime can edit any entry on Wikipedia. Does this mean that the entries are unreliable? Yes and no. Because the entries change with varying frequency, you must be careful and closely read every entry. Do not accept what it says at face value. Think about what the entry says and ask yourself if you can trust it. If you are worried, check the entry&#8217;s history to see what changes have taken place. If you find an error or vandalism on an entry, log in and fix it!</p>
<h3>Weblog</h3>
<p>Everyone in class is required to sign up for a free weblog at <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a>. Please do not ask to use another service; I will only accept blog posts published through WordPress. You are free to cancel your blog at the end of the semester, but WordPress is a great service should you wish to continue blogging beyond this course.WordPress is a reliable, easy-to-use service, and I do not have time to help troubleshoot other blogging services. <strong>you must</strong> turn in your blog assignments through your WordPress blog.</p>
<h3>Camera</h3>
<p>Access to a camera, digital or film, is also required for this course. You can use any film camera, even a disposable camera (which usually cost around $5.00). You must, however, obtain digital copies of your pictures. This can be accomplished easily through vendors that offer film development. In most cases, you can ask to have your photos copied onto a compact disk.</p>
<p>You will need access to a camera to complete the National Mall Photo Album project.</p>
<h3>Flickr</h3>
<p>You are required to obtain a free account on the photo sharing service <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>. We will use Flickr to complete several assignments throughout the course, and you will use Flickr to complete the National Mall Photo Album project. If you already have a Flickr account, feel free to use that account, or create a new one for this class. I will not accept assignments using other photo-sharing services.</p>

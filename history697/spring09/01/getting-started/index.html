				<p>Welcome to Clio Wired 2! We&#8217;ll be discussing the course syllabus tonight. Please take some time before our next class to <a href="../../wp-login.php%3Fregistration=disabled.html">register for this course site</a>, and provide your blog URL. </p>
<p>The design still needs some updates, and I need to add content to the homepage and the Students page. I&#8217;ll use this space to provide updates about the course, and share any articles or websites relevant to our class meetings. </p>

				<p>I am more than delighted to be the sacrifical lamb and jump in. With regards the 697 course it is a little intimidating for people such as me with only limited exposure to the mechanics of this type of work, but I do heartly subscribe to Jeremy&#8217;s comments on Monday night about the value of better understanding how all this works.</p>
<p>I have also had some very interesting stares and comments from people who have seen me carrying around Scott McCloud&#8217;s book. Virtually everyone assumes that it must be a DC Comics-style book, or as one person said, &#8220;is that one of those graphic comic things,&#8221; and expresses surprise that I would be reading a comic book. I have to say that I am finding it vey amusing and while I could explain what the book is about I am quite delighted to go on letting people assume they know what it is that I am reading. </p>
<p>It is going to be a very interesting semester.</p>

				<p>In the Meyer book, specifically page 25 and the fifth editing exercise, I have followed his instructions to the letter and tried it about five times but I cannot make the light purple background adjust to the width of the sidebar. The line is font-size: 1.25em; margin 0 -0.8em; Has anyone else encountered this or is it my first stumbling effort at changing the lines of code? Ironically, every other exercise worked exactly as laid out.</p>
